<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="dropcap1" style="width: 1.0em;">W</span><b>HY</b>, dreams from dreams in dreams remembered! naught</p>
<p>Save this, alas! that once it seemed I thought</p>
<p>I wandered dim with someone, but I knew</p>
<p>Not who; most beautiful and good and true,</p>
<p>Yet sad through suffering; with curl-crowned brow,</p>
<p>Soft eyes and voice; so white she haunts me now:&mdash;</p>
<p>And when, and where?&mdash;At night in dreamland.</p>
<p class="i36">                                  She</p>
<p>Led me athwart a flower-showered lea</p>
<p>Where trammeled puckered pansy and the pea;</p>
<p>Spread stains of pale-rod poppies rinced of rain,</p>
<p>So gorged with sun their hurt hearts ached with pain;</p>
<p>Heaped honeysuckles; roses lavishing beams,</p>
<p>Wherein I knew were huddled little dreams</p>
<p>Which laughed coy, hidden merriment and there</p>
<p>Blew quick gay kisses fragrancing the air.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
<p>And where a river bubbled through the sward</p>
<p>A mist lay sleepily; and it was hard</p>
<p>To see whence sprung it, to what seas it led,</p>
<p>How broadly spread and what it was it fled</p>
<p>So ceasless in its sighs, and bickering on</p>
<p>Into romance or some bewildering dawn</p>
<p>Of wisest legend from the storied wells</p>
<p>Of lost Baranton, where old Merlin dwells,</p>
<p>Nodding a white poll and a grand, gray beard</p>
<p>As if some Lake Lady√© he, listening, heard,</p>
<p>Who spake like water, danced like careful showers</p>
<p>With blown gold curls thro' drifts of wild-thorn flowers;</p>
<p>Loose, lazy arms in graceful movement tossed,</p>
<p>Float flower-like down a woodland vista, lost</p>
<p>In some peculiar note that wrings a tear</p>
<p>Slow down his withered cheek. And then steals near</p>
<p>Her sweet, lascivious brow's white wonderment,</p>
<p>And gray rude eyes, and hair which hath the scent</p>
<p>Of the wildwood Br√©c√©liand's perfumes</p>
<p>In Brittany; and in it one red bloom's</p>
<p>Blood-drop thrust deep, and so "Sweet Viviane!"</p>
<p>All the glad leaves lisp like a young, soft rain</p>
<p>From top to top, until a running surge</p>
<p>The dark, witch-haunted solitude will urge,</p>
<p>That shakes and sounds and stammers as from sleep</p>
<p>Some giant were aroused; and with a leap</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
<p>A samite-gauzy creature, glossy white,</p>
<p>Showers mocking kisses fast and, like a light</p>
<p>Beat by a gust to flutter and then done,</p>
<p>From Br√©c√©liande and Merlin she is gone.</p>
<p>But still he sits there drowsing with his dreams;</p>
<p>A wondrous cohort hath he; many as gleams</p>
<p>That stab the moted mazes of a beech;</p>
<p>And each grave dream hath its own magic speech</p>
<p>To sting to tears his old eyes heavy&mdash;two</p>
<p>Hang, tangled brilliants, in his beard like dew:</p>
<p>And still faint murmurs of courts brave and fair,</p>
<p>And forms of Arthur and proud Guenevere,</p>
<p>Grave Tristram and rare Isoud and stout Mark,</p>
<p>Bold Launcelot, chaste Galahad the dark</p>
<p>Of his weak mind, once strong, glares up with, then,</p>
<p>&mdash;The instant's fostered blossoms&mdash;die again.</p>
<p>A roar of tournament, a rippling stir</p>
<p>Of silken lists that ramble into her,</p>
<p>That white witch-mothered beauty, Viviane,</p>
<p>The vast Br√©c√©liande and dreams again.</p>
<p>Then Dagonet, King Arthur's fool, trips there,</p>
<p>A waggish cunning; glittering on his hair</p>
<p>A tinsel crown; and then will slightly sway</p>
<p>Thick leaves and part, and there Morgane the Fay</p>
<p>With haughty wicked eyes and lovely face</p>
<p>Studies him steady for a little space.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -1.1em;">"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.3em;"><span class="dropcap1" style="width: 0.6em;">T</span><b>HOU</b> askest with thy studious eyes again,</p>
<p>Here where the restless forest hears the main</p>
<p>Toss in a troubled sleep and moan. Ah, sweet,</p>
<p>With joy and passion the kind hour's replete;</p>
<p>And what wild beauty here! where roughly run</p>
<p>Huge forest shadows from the westering sun,</p>
<p>The wood's a subdued power gentle as</p>
<p>Yon tame wild-things, that in the moss and grass</p>
<p>Gaze with their human eyes. Here grow the lines</p>
<p>Of pale-starred green; and where yon fountain shines</p>
<p>Urned in its tremulous ferns, rest we upon</p>
<p>This oak-trunk of God's thunder overthrown</p>
<p>Years, years agone; not where 'tis rotted brown</p>
<p>But where the thick bark's firm and overgrown</p>
<p>Of clambering ivy blackly berried; where</p>
<p>Wild musk of wood decay just tincts the air,</p>
<p>As if some strange shrub on some whispering way,</p>
<p>In some dewed dell, while dreaming of one May,</p>
<p>In longing languor weakly tried to wake</p>
<p>One sometime blossom and could only make</p>
<p>Ghosts of such dead aromas as it knew,</p>
<p>And shape a specter, budding thin as dew,</p>
<p>To haunt these sounding miles of solitude.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>
<p>Troubled thou askest, Morgane, and the mood,</p>
<p>Unfathomed in thine eyes, glows rash and deep</p>
<p>As that in some wild-woman's found on sleep</p>
<p>By some lost knight upon a precipice,</p>
<p>Whom he hath wakened with a laughing kiss.</p>
<p>As that of some frail, elfin lady white</p>
<p>As if of watery moonbeams, filmy dight,</p>
<p>Who waves diaphanous beauty on some cliff</p>
<p>That drowsing purrs with moon-drenched pines; but if</p>
<p>The lone knight follow, foul fiends rise and drag</p>
<p>Him crashing down, while she, tall on the crag,</p>
<p>Triumphant mocks him with glad sorcery</p>
<p>Till all the wildwood echoes shout with glee.</p>
<p>As that bewildering mystery of a tarn,</p>
<p>Some mountain water, which the mornings scorn</p>
<p>To anadem with fire and leave gray;</p>
<p>To which some champion cometh when the Day</p>
<p>Hath tired of breding on his proud, young head</p>
<p>Flame-furry blooms and, golden chaplet√©d,</p>
<p>Sits rosy, trembling with full love for Night,</p>
<p>Who cometh sandaled; dark in crape; the light</p>
<p>Of her good eyes a marvel; her vast hair</p>
<p>Tortuous with stars,&mdash;as in some shadowy lair</p>
<p>The eyes of hunted wild things burn with rage,&mdash;</p>
<p>And on large bosoms doth his love assuage.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"He, coming thither in that haunted place,</p>
<p>Stoops low to quaff cool waters, when his face</p>
<p>Meets gurgling fairy faces in a ring</p>
<p>That jostle upward babbling; beckoning</p>
<p>Him deep to wonders secret built of old</p>
<p>By some dim witch: 'A city walled with gold,</p>
<p>With beryl battlements and paved with pearls,</p>
<p>Slim, lambent towers wrought of foamy swirls</p>
<p>Of alabaster, and that witch to love,</p>
<p>More beautiful to love than queens above.'&mdash;</p>
<p>He pauses troubled, but a wizard power,</p>
<p>In all his bronzen harness that mad hour</p>
<p>Plunges him&mdash;whither? what if he should miss</p>
<p>Those cloudy beauties and that creature's kiss?</p>
<p>Ah, Morgane, that same power Accolon</p>
<p>Saw potent in thine eyes and it hath drawn</p>
<p>Him deep to plunge&mdash;and to what breathless fate?&mdash;</p>
<p>Bliss?&mdash;which, too true, he hath well quaffed of late!</p>
<p>But, there!&mdash;may come what stealthy-footed Death</p>
<p>With bony claws to clutch away his breath!</p>
<p>And make him loveless to those eyes, alas!&mdash;</p>
<p>Fain must I speak that vision; thus it was:</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"In sleep one plucked me some warm fleurs-de-lis,</p>
<p>Larger than those of earth; and I might see</p>
<p>Their woolly gold, loose, webby woven thro',&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
<p>Like fluffy flames spun,&mdash;gauzy with fine dew.</p>
<p>And 'asphodels!' I murmured; then, 'these sure</p>
<p>The Eden amaranths, so angel pure</p>
<p>That these alone may pluck them; aye and aye!</p>
<p>But with that giving, lo, she passed away</p>
<p>Beyond me on some misty, yearning brook</p>
<p>With some sweet song, which all the wild air took</p>
<p>With torn farewells and pensive melody</p>
<p>Touching to tears, strange, hopeless utterly.</p>
<p>So merciless sweet that I yearned high to tear</p>
<p>Those ingot-cored and gold-crowned lilies fair;</p>
<p>Yet over me a horror which restrained</p>
<p>With melancholy presence of two pained</p>
<p>And awful, mighty eyes that cowed and held</p>
<p>Me weeping while that sad dirge died or swelled</p>
<p>Far, far on endless waters borne away:</p>
<p>A wild bird's musick smitten when the ray</p>
<p>Of dawn it burned for graced its drooping head,</p>
<p>And the pale glory strengthened round it dead;</p>
<p>Daggered of thorns it plunged on, blind in night,</p>
<p>The slow blood ruby on its plumage white.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Then, then I knew these blooms which she had given</p>
<p>Were strays of parting grief and waifs of Heaven</p>

<p>Said: "And didst love me as thy lips have spake</p>
<p>No visions wrought of sleep might such love shake.</p>
<p>Fast is all Love in fastness of his power,</p>

<p>Not so built as to chink from fact a beam</p>
<p>Of doubt and much less of a doubt from dream;</p>
<p><i>Such</i>, the alchemic fires of Love's desires,</p>
<p>Which hug this like a snake, melt to gold wires</p>
<p>To chord the old lyre new whereon he lyres."</p>
<p>So ceased and then, sad softness in her eye</p>
<p>Sang to his dream a questioning reply:</p>

<p>Wherein the five were worsted, I was brought</p>
<p>To some king's castle on my shield, methought,&mdash;</p>
<p>Out of the grind of spears and roar of swords,</p>
<p>From the loud shields of battle-bloody lords,</p>
<p>Culled from the mountained slain where Havoc sprawled</p>
<p>Gorged to her eyes with carnage, growling crawled;&mdash;</p>
<p>By some tall damsels tiremaids of some queen</p>
<p>Stately and dark, who moved as if a sheen</p>
<p>Of starlight spread her presence; and she came</p>
<p>With healing herbs and searched my wounds. A dame</p>
<p>So marvelous in raiment silvery</p>
<p>I feared lest some attendant chaste were she</p>
<p>To that high Holy Grael, which Arthur hath</p>
<p>Sought ever widely by hoar wood and path;&mdash;</p>
<p>Thus not for me, a worldly one, to love,</p>
<p>Who loved her even to wonder; skied above</p>
<p>His worship as our moon above the Main,</p>
<p>That passions upward yearning in great pain,</p>
<p>And suffers wearily from year to year,</p>
<p>She peaceful pitiless with virgin cheer.&mdash;</p>
<p>Ah, ideal love, as merciless as fate!</p>
<p>And, oh, that savage aching which must wait</p>
<p>For its fulfillment, tortured love in tears,</p>
<p>Until that beauty dreamed of many years</p>
<p>Bends over one from luminous skies, so grand</p>
<p>One's weakness fears to touch its mastering hand,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
<p>And hesitates and stammers nothings weak,</p>
<p>And loves and loves with love that can not speak!</p>
<p>Ah, there's the tyranny that breeds despair;</p>
<p>Breaks hearts whose strong youth by one golden hair</p>
<p>Coiled 'round the throat is sooner strangled dumb</p>
<p>Than by a glancing dagger thrust from gloom</p>
<p>Of an old arras at the very hour</p>
<p>One thought one safest in one's guarded tower.&mdash;</p>
<p>Thus, Morgane, worshiping that lady I</p>
<p>Was speechless; longing now to live, now die,</p>
<p>As her fine face suggested secrets of</p>
<p>Some passion kin to mine, or scorn of love</p>
<p>That dragged heroic humbleness to her feet,</p>
<p>For one long look that spake and made such sweet.</p>
<p>Ah, never dreamed I of what was to be,&mdash;</p>
<p>Nay! nay! how could I? while that agony</p>
<p>Of doubtful love denied my heart too much,</p>

<p>Unbound deep locks; and, like a blossom faced,</p>
<p>Stood sweet an unswayed stem that ran to bud</p>
<p>In breasts and face a graceful womanhood.</p>

<p>As odor to the rose; and she a tall,</p>

<p>Then all mine eyes and lips and limbs were fire;</p>
<p>My tongue delirious throbbed a lawless lyre,</p>

<p>Inspired of such, but these I can not guess.</p>
<p>Then she, as pure as snows of peaks that keep</p>
<p>Sun-cloven crowns of virgin, vanquishing steep,</p>
<p>Frowned on me, and the thoughts, that in my brain</p>

<p>Temptation harbored, like a bloody rust</p>

<p>So soft a taper had not bent aside,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
<p>And leaned a soft face seen thro' loosened hair</p>
<p>Above me, whisp'ring as if sweet in prayer,</p>
<p>'Behold, the sword! I take the sword away!'</p>
<p>It curved and clashed where the strewn rushes lay;</p>

<p>Dark woodland green, a boar-spear held between</p>
<p>His selle and hunter's head, and at his thigh</p>
<p>A good, broad hanger, and one fist on high</p>
<p>To wind the rapid echoes from his horn,</p>
<p>That start the field birds from the sheav√©d corn,</p>
<p>Uphurled in vollies of audacious wings,</p>
<p>That cease again when it no longer sings.</p>

<p>Wild herds before the baffled foresters.</p>
<p>And treed aloft a reckless laugh one hears,</p>
<p>As if some helping goblin from the trees</p>
<p>Mocked them the unbayed hart and made a breeze</p>
<p>His pursuivant of mocking. Hastening thence</p>
<p>Pursued King Arthur and King Urience</p>
<p>With one small brachet, till scarce hear could they</p>
<p>Their fellowship far-furthered course away</p>
<p>On fresher trace of hind or rugged boar</p>
<p>With haggard, hairy flanks, curled tusks and hoar</p>
<p>With fierce foam-fury; and of these bereft</p>
<p>The kings continued in the slot they'd left.</p>
<p>And there the hart plunged gallant thro' the brake</p>
<p>Leaving a torn path shaking in his wake,</p>
<p>Down which they followed on thro' many a copse</p>
<p>Above whose brush, close on before, the tops</p>
<p>Of the large antlers swelled anon, and so</p>
<p>Were gone where beat the brambles to and fro.</p>
<p>And still they drave him hard; and ever near</p>
<p>Seemed that great hart unwearied; and such cheer</p>
<p>Still stung them to the chase. When Arthur's horse</p>

<p>Seen thither with due worship, ye shall sleep."</p>
<p>And then they came o'erwearied to a hall,</p>
<p>An owlet-haunted pile, whose weedy wall</p>
<p>Towered based on crags rough, windy turrets high;</p>
<p>An old, gaunt giant-castle 'gainst a sky</p>
<p>Wherein the moon hung foam-faced, large and full.</p>
<p>Down on dank sea-foundations broke the dull,</p>
<p>Weird monotone of ocean, and wide rolled</p>
<p>The watery wilderness that was as old</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
<p>As loud, defying headlands stretching out</p>
<p>Beneath still stars with a voluminous shout</p>
<p>Of wreck and wrath forever. Here the two</p>
<p>Were feasted fairly and with worship due</p>
<p>All errant knights, and then a damsel led</p>
<p>Each knight with flaring lamp unto his bed</p>
<p>Down separate corridores of that great keep;</p>
<p>And soon they rested in a heavy sleep.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And then King Arthur woke, and woke mid groans</p>
<p>Of dolorous knights; and 'round him lay the bones</p>
<p>Of many woful champions mouldering;</p>
<p>And he could hear the open ocean ring</p>
<p>Wild wasted waves above. And so he thought</p>
<p>"It is some nightmare weighing me, distraught</p>
<p>By that long hunt;" and then he sought to shake</p>
<p>The horror off and to himself awake;</p>
<p>But still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs,</p>
<p>And deep in iron-ribb√©d cells the eyes</p>
<p>Of pale, cadaverous knights shone fixed on him</p>
<p>Unhappy; and he felt his senses swim</p>
<p>With foulness of that cell, and, "What are ye?</p>
<p>Ghosts of chained champions or a company</p>
<p>Of phantoms, bodiless fiends? If speak ye can,</p>
<p>Speak, in God's name! for I am here&mdash;a man!"</p>
<p>Then groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
<p>A dusky nightmare dying day by day,</p>
<p>Yet once of comely mien and strong withal</p>
<p>And greatly gracious; but, now hunger-tall,</p>
<p>With scrawny beard and faded hands and cheeks:</p>
<p>"Sir knight," said he, "know that the wretch who speaks</p>
<p>Is but an one of twenty knights here shamed</p>
<p>Of him who lords this castle, Damas named,</p>
<p>Who mews us here for slow starvation keen;</p>
<p>Around you fade the bones of some eighteen</p>
<p>Tried knights of Britain; and God grant that soon</p>
<p>My hunger-lengthened ghost will see the moon,</p>
<p>Beyond the vileness of this prisonment!"</p>
<p>With that he sighed and round the dungeon went</p>
<p>A rustling sigh, like saddened sin, and so</p>
<p>Another dim, thin voice complained their woe:&mdash;</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"He doth enchain us with this common end,</p>
<p>That he find one who will his prowess bend</p>
<p>To the attainment of his livelihood.</p>
<p>A younger brother, Ontzlake, hath he; good</p>
<p>And courteous, withal most noble, whom</p>
<p>This Damas hates&mdash;yea, ever seeks his doom;</p>
<p>Denying him to their estate all right</p>
<p>Save that he holds by main of arms and might.</p>
<p>And thro' puissance hath he some fat fields</p>
<p>And one rich manor sumptuous, where he yields</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
<p>Belated knights host's hospitality.</p>
<p>Then bold is Ontzlake, Damas cowardly.</p>
<p>For Ontzlake would decide by sword and lance</p>
<p>Body for body this inheritance;</p>
<p>But Damas dotes on life so courageless;</p>
<p>Thus on all knights perforce lays coward's stress</p>
<p>To fight for him or starve. For ye must know</p>
<p>That in his country he is hated so</p>
<p>That no helm here is who will take the fight;</p>
<p>Thus fortunes it our plight is such a plight."</p>
<p>Quoth he and ceased. And wondering at the tale</p>
<p>The King was thoughtful, and each faded, pale,</p>
<p>Poor countenance still conned him when he spake:</p>
<p>"And what reward if one this battle take?"</p>
<p>"Deliverance for all if of us one</p>
<p>Consent to be his party's champion.</p>
<p>But treachery and he are so close kin</p>
<p>We loathe the part as some misshapen sin,</p>
<p>And here would rather dally on to death</p>
<p>Than serving falseness save and slave our breath."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"May God deliver you for mercy, sirs!"</p>
<p>And right anon an iron noise he hears</p>
<p>Of chains clanked loose and bars jarred rusty back,</p>
<p>The heavy gate croak open; and the black</p>
<p>Of that rank cell astonished was with light,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
<p>That danced fantastic with the frantic night.</p>
<p>One high torch sidewise worried by the gust</p>
<p>Sunned that lorn den of hunger, death and rust,</p>
<p>And one tall damsel vaguely vestured, fair</p>
<p>With shadowy hair, poised on the rocky stair.</p>
<p>And laughing on the King, "What cheer?" said she;</p>
<p>"God's life! the keep stinks vilely! and to see</p>
<p>So noble knights endungeoned hollowing here</p>
<p>Doth pain me sore with pity&mdash;but, what cheer?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Thou mockest us; for me the sorriest</p>
<p>Since I was suckled; and of any quest</p>
<p>To me the most imperiling and strange.&mdash;</p>
<p>But what wouldst thou?" said Arthur. She, "A change</p>
<p>I offer thee, through thee to these with thee,</p>
<p>And thou but grant me in love's courtesy</p>
<p>To fight for Damas and his livelihood.</p>
<p>And if thou wilt not&mdash;look! thou seest this brood</p>
<p>Of lean and dwindled bellies specter-eyed,</p>
<p>Keen knights erst who refused me?&mdash;so decide."</p>
<p>Then thought the King of the sweet sky, the breeze</p>
<p>That blew delirious over waves and trees;</p>
<p>Thick fields of grasses and the sunny earth</p>
<p>Whose beating heat filled the red heart with mirth,</p>
<p>And made the world one sovereign pleasure house</p>
<p>Where king and serf might revel and carouse;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
<p>Then of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills;</p>
<p>Lone forest chapels by their radiant rills:</p>
<p>His palace rich at Caerlleon upon Usk,</p>
<p>And Camelot's loud halls that thro' the dusk</p>
<p>Blazed far and bloomed a rose of revelry;</p>
<p>Or in the misty morning shadowy</p>
<p>Loomed grave for audience. And then he thought</p>
<p>Of his Round Table and that Grael wide sought</p>
<p>In haunted holds on demon-sinful shore;</p>
<p>Then marveled of what wars would rise and roar</p>
<p>With dragon heads unconquered and devour</p>
<p>This realm of Britain and pluck up that flower</p>
<p>Of chivalry whence ripened his renown:</p>
<p>And then the reign of some besotted crown,</p>
<p>A bandit king of lust, idolatry&mdash;</p>
<p>And with that thought for tears he could not see:</p>
<p>Then of his greatest champions, King Ban's son,</p>
<p>And Galahad and Tristram, Accolon:</p>
<p>And then, ah God! of his dear Guenevere,</p>
<p>And with that thought&mdash;to starve and moulder here?&mdash;</p>
<p>For, being unfriend to Arthur and his court,</p>
<p>Well wist he this grim Earl would bless that sport</p>
<p>Of fortune which had fortuned him so well</p>
<p>To have to starve his sovereign in a cell.&mdash;</p>
<p>In the entombing rock where ground the deep;</p>
<p>And all the life shut in his limbs did leap</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
<p>Thro' eager veins and sinews fierce and red,</p>
<p>Stung on to action, and he rose and said:</p>
<p>"That which thou askest is right hard, but, lo!</p>
<p>To rot here harder; I will fight his foe.</p>
<p>But, mark, I have no weapons and no mail,</p>
<p>No steed against that other to avail."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Fear not for that; and thou shalt lack none, sire."</p>
<p>And so she led the path: her torch's fire</p>
<p>Scaring wild spidery shadows at each stride</p>
<p>From cob-webbed coignes of scowling passes wide,</p>
<p>That labyrinthed the rock foundation strong</p>
<p>Of that ungainly fortress bleak of wrong.</p>
<p>At length they came to a nail-studded door,</p>
<p>Which she unlocked with one harsh key she bore</p>
<p>Mid many keys bunched at her girdle; thence</p>
<p>They issued on a terraced eminence.</p>
<p>Beneath the sea broke sounding; and the King</p>
<p>Breathed open air that had the smell and sting</p>
<p>Of brine morn-vigored and blue-billowed foam;</p>
<p>For in the East the second dawning's gloam,</p>
<p>Since that unlucky chase, was freaked with streaks</p>
<p>Red as the ripe stripes of an apple's cheeks.</p>
<p>And so within that larger light of dawn</p>
<p>It seemed to Arthur now that he had known</p>
<p>This maiden at his court, and so he asked.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
<p>But she, well-tutored, her real person masked,</p>
<p>And answered falsely; "Nay, deceive thee not;</p>
<p>Thou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur's court, I wot.</p>
<p>For here it likes me best to sing and spin</p>
<p>And work the hangings my sire's halls within:</p>
<p>No courts or tournaments or gallants brave</p>
<p>To flatter me and love! for me&mdash;the wave,</p>
<p>The forest, field and sky; the calm, the storm;</p>
<p>My garth wherein I walk to think; the charm</p>
<p>Of uplands redolent at bounteous noon</p>
<p>And full of sunlight; night's free stars and moon;</p>
<p>White ships that pass some several every year;</p>
<p>These lonesome towers and those wild mews to hear."</p>
<p>"An owlet maid!" the King laughed. But, untrue</p>
<p>Was she, and of false Morgane's treasonous crew,</p>
<p>Who worked vile wiles ev'n to the slaying of</p>
<p>The King, half-brother, whom she did not love.</p>
<p>And presently she brought him where in state</p>
<p>This swarthy Damas with mailed cowards sate....</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>King Urience that dawning woke and found</p>
<p>Himself safe couched at Camelot and wound</p>
<p>In Morgane's arms; nor weened he how it was</p>
<p>That this thing secretly had come to pass.</p>
<p>But Accolon at Chariot sojourned still</p>
<p>Content with his own dreams; for 'twas the will</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
<p>Of Morgane thus to keep him hidden here</p>
<p>For her desire's excess, where everywhere</p>
<p>In Gore by wood and river pleasure houses,</p>
<p>Pavilions, rose of rock for love carouses;</p>
<p>And there in one, where 'twas her dearest wont</p>
<p>To list a tinkling, falling water fount,&mdash;</p>
<p>Which thro' sweet talks of idle paramours</p>
<p>At sensuous ease on tumbled beds of flowers,</p>
<p>Had caught a laughing language light thereof,</p>
<p>And rambled ever gently whispering, "love!"&mdash;</p>
<p>On cool white walls her hands had deftly draped</p>
<p>A dark rich hanging, where were worked and shaped</p>
<p>Her fullest hours of pleasure flesh and mind,</p>
<p>Imperishable passions, which could wind</p>
<p>The past and present quickly; and could mate</p>
<p>Dead loves to kisses, and intoxicate</p>
<p>With moon-soft words of past delight and song</p>
<p>The heavy heart that wronged forgot the wrong.</p>
<p>And there beside it pooled the urn√©d well,</p>
<p>And slipping thence thro' dripping shadows fell</p>
<p>From rippling rock to rock. Here Accolon,</p>
<p>With Morgane's hollow lute, one studious dawn</p>
<p>Came solely; with not ev'n her brindled hound</p>
<p>To leap beside him o'er the gleaming ground;</p>
<p>No handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair,</p>
<p>Or paging dwarf in purple with him there;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
<p>But this her lute, about which her perfume</p>
<p>Clung odorous of memories, that made bloom</p>
<p>Her flowing features rosy to his eyes,</p>
<p>That saw the words, his sense could but surmise,</p>
<p>Shaped on dim, breathing lips; the laugh that drunk</p>
<p>Her deep soul-fire from eyes wherein it sunk</p>
<p>And slowly waned away to smouldering dreams,</p>
<p>Fathomless with thought, far in their dove-gray gleams.</p>
<p>And so for those most serious eyes and lips,</p>
<p>Faint, filmy features, all the music slips</p>
<p>Of buoyant being bubbling to his voice</p>
<p>To chant her praises; and with nervous poise</p>
<p>His fleet, trained fingers call from her long lute</p>
<p>Such riotous notes as must make madly mute</p>
<p>The nightingale that listens quivering.</p>
<p>And well he knows that winging hence it'll sing</p>
<p>These aching notes, whose beauties burn and pain</p>
<p>Its anguished heart now sobless, not in vain</p>
<p>Wild 'neath her casement in that garden old</p>
<p>Dingled with heavy roses; in the gold</p>
<p>Of Camelot's stars and pearl-encrusted moon;</p>
<p>And if it dies, the heartache of the tune</p>
<p>Shall clamor stormy passion at her ear,</p>
<p>Of death more dear than life if love be there;</p>
<p>Melt her quick eyes to tears, her throat to sobs</p>
<p>Tumultuous heaved, while separation throbs</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
<p>Hard at her heart, and longing rears to Death</p>
<p>Two prayerful eyes of pleading "for one breath&mdash;</p>
<p>An ardor of fierce life&mdash;crushed in his arms</p>
<p>Close, close! and, oh, for such, all these smooth charms,</p>
<p>Full, sentient charms voluptuous evermore!"</p>
<p>And sweet to know these sensitive vows shall soar</p>
<p>Ev'n to the dull ear of her drowsy lord</p>
<p>Beside her; heart-defying with each word</p>
<p>Harped in the bird's voice rhythmically clear.</p>
<p>And thus he sang to her who was not there:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="dropcap1" style="width: 0.6em;">T</span><b>HE</b> eve now came; and shadows cowled the way</p>
<p>Like somber palmers, who have kneeled to pray</p>
<p>Beside a wayside shrine, and rosy rolled</p>
<p>Up the capacious West a grainy gold,</p>
<p>Luxuriant fluid, burned thro' strong, keen skies,</p>
<p>Which seemed as towering gates of Paradise</p>
<p>Surged dim, far glories on the hungry gaze.</p>
<p>And from that sunset down the roseate ways,</p>
<p>To Accolon, who with his idle lute,</p>
<p>Reclined in revery against a root</p>
<p>Of a great oak, a fragment of that West,</p>
<p>A dwarf, in crimson satin tightly dressed,</p>
<p>Skipped like a leaf the rather frosts have burned</p>
<p>And cozened to a fever red, that turned</p>
<p>And withered all its sap. And this one came</p>
<p>From Camelot; from his beloved dame,</p>
<p>Morgane the Fay. He on his shoulder bore</p>
<p>A burning blade wrought strange with wizard lore,</p>
<p>Runed mystically; and a scabbard which</p>
<p>Glared venomous, with angry jewels rich.</p>
<p>He, louting to the knight, "Sir knight," said he,</p>
<p>"Your lady with all sweetest courtesy</p>
<p>Assures you&mdash;ah, unworthy messenger</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
<p>I of such brightness!&mdash;of that love of her."</p>
<p>Then doffing that great baldric, with the sword</p>
<p>To him he gave: "And this from him, my lord</p>
<p>King Arthur; even his Excalibur,</p>
<p>The sovereign blade, which Merlin gat of her,</p>
<p>The Ladye of the Lake, who Launcelot</p>
<p>Fostered from infanthood, as well you wot,</p>
<p>In some wierd mere in Briogn's tangled lands</p>
<p>Of charms and mist; where filmy fairy bands</p>
<p>By lazy moons of Autumn spin their fill</p>
<p>Of giddy morrice on the frosty hill.</p>
<p>By goodness of her favor this is sent;</p>
<p>Who craved King Arthur boon with this intent:</p>
<p>That soon for her a desperate combat one</p>
<p>With one of mightier prowess were begun;</p>
<p>And with the sword Excalibur right sure</p>
<p>Were she against that champion to endure.</p>
<p>The blade flame-trenchant, but more prize the sheath</p>
<p>Which stauncheth blood and guardeth from all death."</p>
<p>He said: and Accolon looked on the sword,</p>
<p>A mystic falchion, and, "It shall wend hard</p>
<p>With him thro' thee, unconquerable blade,</p>
<p>Whoe'er he be, who on my Queen hath laid</p>
<p>Stress of unworship: and the hours as slow</p>

<p>Plead her grace mercy for so long delay</p>
<p>From love that dies an hourly death each day</p>
<p>Till her white hands kissed he shall kiss her face,</p>
<p>By which his life breathes in continual grace."</p>
<p>Thus he commanded; and incontinent</p>
<p>The dwarf departed like a red ray sent</p>
<p>From rich down-flowering clouds of suffused light</p>
<p>Winged o'er long, purple glooms; and with the night,</p>
<p>Whose votaress cypress stoled the dying strife</p>
<p>Softly of day, and for whose perished life</p>

<p>From Ontzlake's manor, where he languished; sore</p>
<p>Hurt in the lists, a spear thrust in his thigh:</p>
<p>Who had besought&mdash;for much he feared to die&mdash;</p>
<p>This knight and his fair lady, as they rode</p>
<p>To hawk near Chariot, the Queen's abode,</p>
<p>That they would pray her in all charity</p>
<p>Fare post to him,&mdash;for in chirurgery</p>
<p>Of all that land she was the greatest leach,&mdash;</p>
<p>And her to his recovery beseech.</p>
<p>So, Accolon saluted, they drew rein,</p>
<p>And spake their message,&mdash;for right over fain</p>
<p>Were they toward their sport,&mdash;that he might bare</p>
<p>Petition to that lady. But, not there</p>
<p>Was Arthur's sister, as they well must wot;</p>
<p>But now a se'nnight lay at Camelot,</p>
<p>Of Guenevere the guest; and there with her</p>
<p>Four other queens of farther Britain were:</p>
<p>Isoud of Ireland, she of Cornwall Queen,</p>
<p>King Mark's wife; who right rarely then was seen</p>
<p>At court for jealousy of Mark, who knew</p>
<p>Her to that lance of Lyonesse how true</p>
<p>Since mutual quaffing of a philter; while</p>
<p>How guilty Guenevere on such could smile:</p>
<p>She of Northgales and she of Eastland: and</p>
<p>She of the Out Isles Queen. A fairer band</p>
<p>For sovereignty and love and loveliness</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
<p>Was not in any realm to grace and bless.</p>
<p>Then quoth the knight, "Ay? see how fortune turns</p>
<p>And varies like an April day, that burns</p>
<p>Now welkins blue with calm, now scowls them down,</p>
<p>Revengeful, with a black storm's wrinkled frown.</p>
<p>For, look, this Damas, who so long hath lain</p>
<p>A hiding vermin, fearful of all pain,</p>
<p>Dark in his bandit towers by the deep,</p>
<p>Wakes from a five years' torpor and a sleep;</p>
<p>So sends dispatch a courier to my lord</p>
<p>With, 'Lo! behold! to-morrow with the sword</p>
<p>Earl Damas by his knight at point of lance</p>
<p>Decides the issue of inheritance,</p>
<p>Body to body, or by champion.'</p>
<p>Right hard to find such ere to-morrow dawn.</p>
<p>Though sore bestead lies Ontzlake, and he could,</p>
<p>Right fain were he to save his livelihood.</p>
<p>Then mused Sir Accolon: "The adventure goes</p>
<p>Ev'n as my Lady fashioneth; who knows</p>
<p>But what her arts develop this and make?"</p>
<p>And thus to those: "His battle I will take,&mdash;</p>
<p>And he be so conditioned, harried of</p>
<p>Estate and life,&mdash;in knighthood and for love.</p>
<p>Conduct me thither."</p>
<p class="i12">            And, gramercied, then</p>
<p>Mounted a void horse of that wondering train,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
<p>And thence departed with two squires. And they</p>
<p>Came to a lone, dismantled priory</p>
<p>Hard by a castle gray on whose square towers,</p>
<p>Machicolated, o'er the forest's bowers,</p>
<p>The immemorial morning bloomed and blushed.</p>
<p>A woodland manor olden, dark embushed</p>
<p>In wild and woody hills. And then one wound</p>
<p>An echoy horn, and with the boundless sound</p>
<p>The drawbridge rumbled moatward clanking, and</p>
<p>Into a paved court passed that little band....</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When all the world was morning, gleam and glare</p>
<p>Of far deluging glory, and the air</p>
<p>Sang with the wood-bird, like a humming lyre</p>
<p>Swept bold of minstrel fingers wire on wire;</p>
<p>Ere that fixed hour of prime came Arthur armed</p>
<p>For battle royally. A black steed warmed</p>
<p>A fierce impatience 'neath him cased in mail,</p>
<p>Huge, foreign; and accoutered head to tail</p>
<p>In costly sendal; rearward wine-dark red,</p>
<p>Amber as sunlight to his fretful head.</p>
<p>Firm, heavy armor blue had Arthur on</p>
<p>Beneath a robe of honor, like the dawn,</p>
<p>Satin and diapered and purflewed deep</p>
<p>With lordly golden purple; whence did sweep</p>
<p>Two hanging acorn tuftings of fine gold,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
<p>And at his thigh a falchion, long and bold,</p>
<p>Heavy and triple-edged; its scabbard, red</p>
<p>Cordovan leather; thence a baldric led</p>
<p>Of new cut deer-skin; this laborious wrought,</p>
<p>And curiously with slides of gold was fraught,</p>
<p>And buckled with a buckle white that shone,</p>
<p>Bone of the sea-horse, tongued with jet-black bone.</p>
<p>And, sapphire-set, a burgonet of gold</p>
<p>Barbaric, wyvern-crested whose throat rolled</p>
<p>A flame-sharp tongue of agate, and whose eyes</p>
<p>Glowed venomous great rubies fierce of prize.</p>
<p>And in his hand, a wiry lance of ash,</p>
<p>Lattened with finest silver, like a flash</p>
<p>Of sunlight in the morning shone a-gash.</p>
<p>Clad was his squire most richly; he whose head</p>
<p>Curled with close locks of yellow tinged to red:</p>
<p>Of noble bearing; fair face; hawk eyes keen,</p>
<p>And youthful, bearded chin. Right well beseen,</p>
<p>Scarfed with blue satin; on his shoulder strong</p>
<p>One broad gold brooch chased strangely, thick and long.</p>
<p>His legs in hose of rarest Totness clad,</p>
<p>And parti-colored leathern shoes he had</p>
<p>Gold-latched; and in his hand a bannered spear</p>
<p>Speckled and bronzen sharpened in the air.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So with his following, while lay like scars</p>
<p>The blue mist thin along the woodland bars,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>
<p>Thro' dew and fog, thro' shadow and thro' ray</p>
<p>Joustward Earl Damas led the forest way.</p>
<p>Then to King Arthur when arrived were these</p>
<p>To where the lists shone silken thro' the trees,</p>
<p>Bannered and draped, a wimpled damsel came,</p>
<p>Secret, upon a palfrey all aflame</p>
<p>With sweat and heat of hurry, and, "From her,</p>
<p>Your sister Morgane, your Excalibur,</p>
<p>With tender greeting: For ye well have need</p>
<p>In this adventure of him. So, God speed!"</p>
<p>And so departed suddenly: nor knew</p>
<p>The king but this his weapon tried and true.</p>
<p>But brittle this and fashioned like thereof,</p>
<p>And false of baser metal, in unlove</p>
<p>And treason to his life, of her of kin</p>
<p>Half sister, Morgane&mdash;an unnatural sin.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then heralded into the lists he rode.</p>
<p>Opposed flashed Accolon, who light bestrode,</p>
<p>Exultant, proud in talisman of that sword,</p>
<p>A dun horse lofty as a haughty lord,</p>
<p>Pure white about each hollow, pasterned hoof.</p>
<p>Equipped shone knight and steed in arms of proof,</p>
<p>Dappled with yellow variegated plate</p>
<p>Of Spanish laton. And of sovereign state</p>
<p>His surcoat robe of honor white and black</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
<p>Of satin, red-silk needled front and back</p>
<p>Then blackly bordered. And above his robe</p>
<p>That two-edged sword,&mdash;a throbbing golden globe</p>
<p>Of vicious jewels,&mdash;thrust its burning hilt,</p>
<p>Its broad belt, tawny and with gold-work gilt,</p>
<p>Clasped with the eyelid of a black sea-horse</p>
<p>Whose tongue was rosy gold. And stern as Force</p>
<p>His visored helmet burned like fire, of rich</p>
<p>And bronzen laton hammered; and on which</p>
<p>An hundred crystals glittered, thick as on</p>
<p>A silver web bright-studding dews of dawn.</p>
<p>The casque's tail crest a taloned griffin ramped,</p>
<p>In whose horned brow one virtuous jewel stamped.</p>
<p>An ashen spear round-shafted, overlaid</p>
<p>With fine blue silver, whereon colors played,</p>
<p>Firm in his iron gauntlet lithely swayed.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Intense on either side an instant stood</p>
<p>Glittering as serpents which, with Spring renewed,</p>
<p>In glassy scales meet on some greening way,</p>
<p>Angry advance, quick tongues at poisonous play.</p>
<p>Then clanged a herald's clarion and sharp heels,</p>
<p>Harsh-spurred, each champion's springing courser feels</p>
<p>Touch to red onset; the aventured spears</p>
<p>Hurled like two sun-bursts of a storm when clears</p>
<p>Laborious thunders; and in middle course</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>
<p>Shrieked shrill the unpierced shields; mailed horse from horse</p>
<p>Lashed madly pawing&mdash;and a hoarse roar rang</p>
<p>From buckram lists, till the wild echoes sang</p>
<p>Of leagues on leagues of forest and of cliff.</p>
<p>Rigid the proof-shelled warriors passed and stiff</p>
<p>Whither their squires fresher spears upheld;</p>
<p>Nor stayed to breathe; but scarcely firmly selled</p>
<p>Launched deadly forward. Shield to savage shield</p>
<p>Opposing; crest to crest, whose fronts did wield</p>
<p>A towering war's unmercifulest scath;</p>
<p>Rocking undaunted, glared wan withering wrath</p>
<p>From balls of jeweled eyes, and raging stood</p>
<p>Slim, slippery bodies, in the sun like blood.</p>
<p>The lance of Accolon, as on a rock</p>
<p>Long storm-launched foam breaks baffled, with the shock,</p>
<p>On Arthur's sounding shield burst splintered force;</p>
<p>But him resistless Arthur's,&mdash;high from horse</p>
<p>Sell-lifted,&mdash;ruinous bare crashing on</p>
<p>A long sword's length; unsaddled Accolon</p>
<p>For one stunned moment lay. Then rising, drew</p>
<p>The great sword at his hip, that shone like dew</p>
<p>Fresh flashed in morn. "Descend;" he stiffly said,</p>
<p>"To proof of better weapons head for head!</p>
<p>Enough of spears, to swords!" and so the knight</p>
<p>Addressed him to the King. Dismounting light,</p>
<p>Arthur his moon-bright brand unsheathed, and high</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
<p>Each covering shield gleamed slanting to the sky,</p>
<p>Relentless, strong, and stubborn; underneath</p>
<p>Their wary shelters foined the glittering death</p>
<p>Of stolid steel thrust livid arm to arm:</p>
<p>As cloud to cloud growls up a soaring storm</p>
<p>Above the bleak wood and lithe lightnings work</p>
<p>Brave blades wild warring, in the black that lurk,</p>
<p>Thus fenced and thrust&mdash;one tortoise shield descends,</p>
<p>Leaps a fierce sword shrill,&mdash;like a flame which sends</p>
<p>A long fang heavenward,&mdash;for a crushing stroke;</p>
<p>Swings hard and trenchant, and, resounding heard,</p>
<p>Sings surly helmward full; defiance reared</p>
<p>Soars to a brother blow to shriek again</p>
<p>Blade on brave blade. And o'er the battered plain,</p>
<p>Forward and backward, blade on baleful blade,</p>
<p>Teeth clenched as visors where the fierce eyes made</p>
<p>A cavernous, smouldering fury, shield at shield,</p>
<p>Unflinchingly remained and scorned to yield.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So Arthur drew aside to rest upon</p>
<p>His falchion for a pause; but Accolon</p>
<p>As yet, thro' virtue of that magic sheath</p>
<p>Fresh and almighty, being no nearer death</p>
<p>Thro' loss of blood than when the trial begun,</p>
<p>Chafed with delay. But Arthur with the sun,</p>
<p>Its thirsty heat, the loss from wounds of blood,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>
<p>Leaned fainting weary and so resting stood.</p>
<p>Cried Accolon, "Here is no time for rest!</p>
<p>Defend thee!" and straight on the monarch pressed;</p>
<p>"Defend or yield thee as one recreant!"</p>
<p>Full on his helm a hewing blow did plant,</p>
<p>Which beat a flying fire from the steel;</p>
<p>Smote, like one drunk with wine, the King did reel,</p>
<p>Breath, brain bewildered. Then, infuriate,</p>
<p>Nerve-stung with vigor by that blow, in hate</p>
<p>Gnarled all his strength into one stroke of might,</p>
<p>And in both fists the huge blade knotted tight,</p>
<p>Swung red, terrific to a sundering stroke.&mdash;</p>
<p>As some bright wind that hurls th' uprooted oak,&mdash;</p>
<p>Boomed full the beaten burgonet he wore:</p>
<p>Hacked thro' and thro' the crest, and cleanly shore</p>
<p>The golden boasting of its griffin fierce</p>
<p>With hollow clamor down astounded ears:</p>
<p>No further thence&mdash;but, shattered to the grass,</p>
<p>That brittle blade, crushed as if made of glass,</p>
<p>Into hot pieces like a broken ray</p>
<p>Burst sunward and in feverish fragments lay.</p>
<p>Then groaned the King unarmed; and so he knew</p>
<p>This no Excalibur; that tried and true</p>
<p>Most perfect tempered, runed and mystical.</p>
<p>Sobbed, "<i>Oh, hell-false! betray me?</i>"&mdash; Then withal</p>
<p>Him seemed this foe, who fought with so much stress,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
<p>So long untiring, and with no distress</p>
<p>Of wounds or heat, through treachery bare his brand;</p>
<p>And then he knew it by its hilt that hand</p>
<p>Clutched to an avenging stroke. For Accolon</p>
<p>In madness urged the belted battle on</p>
<p>His King defenseless; who, the hilted cross</p>
<p>Of that false weapon grasped, beneath the boss</p>
<p>Of his deep-dented shield crouched; and around</p>
<p>Crawled the unequal conflict o'er the ground,</p>
<p>Sharded with shattered spears and off-hewn bits</p>
<p>Of shivered steel and gold that burnt in fits.</p>
<p>So hunted, yet defiant, cowering</p>
<p>Beneath his bossy shield's defense, the King</p>
<p>Persisted stoutly. And, devising still</p>
<p>How to secure his sword and by what skill,</p>
<p>Him so it fortuned when most desperate:</p>
<p>In that hot chase they came where shattered late</p>
<p>Lay tossed the truncheon of a bursten lance,</p>
<p>Which deftly seized, to Accolon's advance</p>
<p>He wielded valorous. Against the fist</p>
<p>Smote where the gauntlet husked the nervous wrist,</p>
<p>Which strained the weapon to a wrathful blow;</p>
<p>Palsied, the tightened sinews of his foe</p>
<p>Loosened from effort, and, the falchion seized,</p>
<p>Easy was yielded. Then the wroth King squeezed,</p>
<p>&mdash;Hurling the moon-disk of his shield afar,&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
<p>Him in both knotted arms of wiry war,</p>
<p>Rocked sidewise twice or thrice,&mdash;as one hath seen</p>
<p>Some stern storm take an ash tree, roaring green,</p>
<p>Nodding its sappy bulk of trunk and boughs</p>
<p>To dizziness, from tough, coiled roots carouse</p>
<p>Its long height thundering;&mdash;so King Arthur shook</p>
<p>Sir Accolon and headlong flung; then took,</p>
<p>Tearing away, that scabbard from his side,</p>
<p>Tossed thro' the breathless lists, that far and wide</p>
<p>Gulped in the battle voiceless. Then right wroth</p>
<p>Secured Excalibur, and grasped of both</p>
<p>Wild hands swung glittering and brought bitter down</p>
<p>On rising Accolon; steel, bone and brawn</p>
<p>Hewed thro' that blow; unsettled every sense:</p>
<p>Bathed in a world of blood his limbs grew tense</p>
<p>And writhen then ungathered limp with death.</p>
<p>Bent to him Arthur, from the brow beneath,</p>
<p>Unlaced the helm and doffed it and so asked,</p>
<p>When the fair forehead's hair curled dark uncasqued,</p>
<p>"Say! ere I slay thee, whence and what thou art?</p>
<p>What King, what court be thine? and from what part,</p>
<p>Speak! or thou diest!&mdash;Yet, that brow, methinks</p>
<p>I have beheld it&mdash;where? say, ere death drinks</p>
<p>The soul-light from life's cups, thine eyes! thou art&mdash;</p>
<p>What art thou, speak!"</p>
<p class="i12">            He answered slow and short</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>
<p>With tortured breathing: "I?&mdash;one, Accolon</p>
<p>Of Gaul, a knight of Arthur's court&mdash;at dawn&mdash;</p>
<p>God wot what now I am for love so slain!"</p>
<p>Then seemed the victor spasmed with keen pain,</p>
<p>Covered with mail√©d hands his visored face;</p>
<p>"Thou Accolon? art Accolon?" a space</p>
<p>Exclaimed and conned him: then asked softly, "Say,</p>
<p>Whence gatest thou this sword, or in what way</p>
<p>Thou hadst it, speak?" But wandering that knight</p>
<p>Heard dully, senses clodded thick with night;</p>
<p>Then rallying earthward: "Woe, woe worth the sword!</p>
<p>&mdash;From love of love who lives, for love yet lord!&mdash;</p>
<p>Morgane!&mdash;thy love for love in love hadst made</p>
<p>Me strong o'er kings an hundred! to have swayed</p>
<p>Britain! had this not risen like a fate,</p>
<p>Spawned up, a Hell's miscarriage sired of Hate!&mdash;</p>
<p>A king? thou curse! a gold and blood crowned king,</p>
<p>With Arthur's sister queen?&mdash;'Twas she who schemed.</p>
<p>And there at Chariot we loved and dreamed</p>
<p>Gone some twelve months. There so we had devolved</p>
<p>How Arthur's death were compassed and resolved</p>
<p>Each liberal morning, like an almoner,</p>
<p>Prodigal of silver to the begging air;</p>
<p>Each turbulent eve that in heaven's turquoise rolled</p>
<p>Convulsive fiery glories deep in gold;</p>
<p>Each night&mdash;hilarious heavens vast of night!&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
<p>Boisterous with quivering stars buoyed bubble-light</p>
<p>In flexuous labyrinths o' the intricate sphere.</p>
<p>We dreamed and spake Ambition at our ear&mdash;</p>
<p>Nay! a crowned curse and crimeful clad she came,</p>
<p>To me, that woman, brighter than a flame;</p>
<p>And laughed on me with pouting lips up-pursed</p>
<p>For kisses which I gave for love: How cursed</p>
<p>Was I thereafter! For, lie fleshed in truth,</p>
<p>She shrivels to a hag! Behind that youth</p>
<p>Ugly, misshapen; Lust not Love, wherein</p>
<p>Germs pregnant seed of Hell for hate and sin.&mdash;</p>
<p><i>I</i> seek for such the proudest height of seat,</p>
<p>King Arthur's kingdom, and bold fame complete?&mdash;</p>
<p>Harlot!&mdash;sweet spouse of Urience King of Gore!&mdash;</p>
<p>Sweet harlot!&mdash;here's that death determined o'er!</p>
<p>And now thou hast thy dream, and dreaming grieve</p>

<p>Nay, nay, I love thee! witness bare this field!</p>

<p>Enow! enow! so hale me hence to die!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then anger in the good King's gloomy eye</p>
<p>Burnt, instant-embered, as one oft may see</p>
<p>A star leak out of heaven and cease to be.</p>
<p>Slow from his visage he his visor raised,</p>
<p>And on the dying one mute moment gazed,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
<p>Then low bespake him grimly: "Accolon,</p>
<p>I am that King." He with an awful groan,</p>
<p>Blade-battered as he was, beheld and knew;</p>
<p>Strained to his tottering knees and haggard drew</p>
<p>Up full his armored tallness, hoarsely cried,</p>
<p>"The King!" and at his mailed feet clashed and died.</p>
<p>Then rose a world of anxious faces pressed</p>
<p>About King Arthur, who, though wound-distressed,</p>
<p>Bespake that multitude: "Whiles breath and power</p>
<p>Remain, judge we these brethren: This harsh hour</p>
<p>Hath yielded Damas all this rich estate;&mdash;</p>
<p>So it is his&mdash;allotted his of Fate</p>
<p>Thro' might of arms; so let it be to him.</p>
<p>For, stood our oath on knighthood not so slim</p>
<p>But that it hath this strong conclusion:</p>
<p>This much by us as errant knight is done:</p>
<p>Now our decree as King of Britain, hear:</p>
<p>We do adjudge this Damas banned fore'er,</p>
<p>Outlawed and exiled from all shores and isles</p>
<p>Of farthest Britain in its many miles.</p>
<p>One month be his&mdash;no more! then will we come</p>
<p>Even with an iron host to seal his doom;</p>
<p>If he be not departed over seas,</p>
<p>Hang naked from his battlements to please</p>
<p>Of carrion ravens and wild hawks the craws.</p>
<p>Thus much for Damas. But our pleasure draws</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
<p>Toward sir Ontzlake, whom it likes the King</p>
<p>To take into his knightly following</p>
<p>Of that Round Table royal.&mdash;Stand our word!&mdash;</p>
<p>But I am overweary; take my sword;&mdash;</p>
<p>Unharness me; for, battle worn, I tire</p>
<p>With bruises' achings and wounds mad with fire;</p>
<p>And monasteryward would I right fain,</p>
<p>Even Glastonbury and with me the slain."</p>
<p>So bare they then the wounded King away,</p>
<p>The dead behind. So, closed the Autumn day.</p>

<p>But when within that abbey he waxed strong,</p>
<p>The King remembering him of all the wrong</p>
<p>That Damas had inflicted on the land,</p>
<p>Commanded Lionell with a staunch band</p>
<p>This weed's out-stamping if still rooted there.</p>
<p>He riding thither to that robber lair,</p>
<p>Led Arthur's hopefulest helms, when thorn on thorn</p>
<p>Reddened an hundred spears one winter morn;</p>
<p>Built up, a bulk of bastioned rock on rock,</p>
<p>Vast battlements, that loomed above the shock</p>
<p>Of freshening foam that climbed with haling hands,</p>
<p>Lone cloudy-clustered turrets in loud lands</p>
<p>Set desolate,&mdash;mournful o'er wide, frozen flats,&mdash;</p>
<p>Found hollow towers the haunt of owls and bats.</p>

<p>With all his foreign weapons. So her trust</p>
<p>Smiled certain of conclusion; eloquent</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
<p>Gave lofty heart bold hope that at large eyes</p>
<p>Piled up imperial dreams of power and prize.</p>
<p>And in her carven chamber, oaken dark,</p>
<p>Traceried and arrased, o'er the barren park</p>
<p>That dripped with Autumn,&mdash;for November lay</p>
<p>Swathed frostily in fog on every spray,&mdash;</p>
<p>Thought at her tri-arched casement lone, one night,</p>
<p>Ere yet came knowledge of that test of might.</p>
<p>Her lord in slumber and the castle dull</p>
<p>With silence or with sad wind-music full.</p>
<p>"And he removed?&mdash;fond fool! <i>he is removed!</i></p>
<p>Death-dull from feet to hair and graveward shoved</p>
<p>From royalty to that degraded state</p>
<p>But purpler pomp! But, see! regenerate</p>
<p>Another monarch rises&mdash;Accolon!&mdash;</p>
<p>Love! Love! with state more ermined; balmy son</p>
<p>Of gods not men, and nobler hence to rule.</p>
<p>Sweet Love almighty, terrible to school</p>
<p>Harsh hearts to gentleness!&mdash;Then all this realm's</p>
<p>Iron-husk√©d flower of war, which overwhelms</p>
<p>With rust and havoc, shall explode and bloom</p>
<p>An asphodel of peace with joy's perfume.</p>
<p>And then, sweet Launcelots and sweet Tristrams proud,</p>
<p>Sweet Gueneveres, sweet Isouds, now allowed</p>
<p>No pleasures but what wary, stolen hours</p>
<p>In golden places have their flaming flowers,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
<p>Shall have curled feasts of passion evermore.</p>
<p>Poor out-thrust Love, now shivering at the door,</p>
<p>No longer, sweet neglected, thou thrust off,</p>
<p>Insulted and derided: nor the scoff</p>
<p>Of bully Power, whose heart of insult flings</p>
<p>Off for the roar of arms the appeal that clings</p>
<p>And lifts a tearful, prayerful pitiful face</p>
<p>Up from his brutal feet: this shrine where grace</p>
<p>Lays woman's life for every sacrifice&mdash;</p>
<p>To him so little, yet of what pure price,</p>
<p>Her all, being all her all for love!&mdash;her soul</p>
<p>Life, honor, earth and firmamental whole</p>
<p>Of God's glad universe; stars, moon and sun;</p>
<p>Creation, death; life ended, life begun.</p>
<p>And if by fleshly love all Heaven's debarred,</p>
<p>Its sinuous revolving spheres instarred,</p>
<p>Then Hell were Heaven with love to those who knew</p>
<p>Love which God's Heaven encouraged&mdash;love that drew</p>
<p>Hips, head and hair in fiends' devouring claws</p>
<p>Down, down its pit's hurled sucking, as down draws,&mdash;</p>
<p>Yet lip to narrow lip with whom we love,&mdash;</p>
<p>A whirlwind some weak, crippled, fallen dove.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Then this lank Urience? He who is lord.&mdash;</p>
<p>Where is thy worry? for, hath he no sword?</p>
<p>No dangerous dagger I, hid softly here</p>

<p>Sharp as an adder's fang? or for that ear</p>
<p>No instant poison which insinuates,</p>

<p>With ice and death? For often men who sleep</p>
<p>On eider-down wake not, but closely keep</p>
<p>Such secrets in their graves to rot and rot</p>
<p>To dust and maggots;&mdash;of these&mdash;which his lot?"</p>
<p>Thus she conspired with her that rainy night</p>
<p>Lone in her chamber; when no haggard, white,</p>
<p>Wan, watery moon dreamed on the streaming pane,</p>
<p>But on the leads beat an incessant rain,</p>
<p>And sighed and moaned a weary wind along</p>
<p>The turrets and torn poplars stirred to song.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So grew her face severe as skies that take</p>
<p>Dark forces of full storm, sound-shod, that shake</p>
<p>With murmurous feet black hills, and stab with fire</p>
<p>A pine some moaning forest mourns as sire.</p>
<p>So touched her countenance that dark intent;</p>
<p>And to still eyes stern thoughts a passion sent,</p>
<p>As midnight waters luminous glass deep</p>
<p>Suggestive worlds of austere stars in sleep,</p>
<p>Vague ghostly gray locked in their hollow gloom.</p>
<p>Then as if some vast wind had swept the room,</p>
<p>Silent, intense, had raised her from her seat,</p>
<p>Of dim, great arms had made her a retreat,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
<p>Secret as love to move in, like some ghost,</p>
<p>Noiseless as death and subtle as sharp frost,</p>
<p>Poised like a light and borne as carefully,</p>
<p>Trod she the gusty hall where shadowy</p>
<p>The stirring hangings rolled a Pagan war.</p>
<p>And there the mail of Urience shone. A star,</p>
<p>Glimmering above, a dying cresset dropped</p>
<p>From the stone vault and flared. And here she stopped</p>
<p>And took the sword bright, burnished by his page,</p>
<p>And ruddy as a flame with restless rage.</p>
<p>Grasping this death unto the chamber where</p>
<p>Slept innocent her spouse she moved&mdash;an air</p>
<p>Twined in soft, glossy sendal; or a fit</p>
<p>Of faery song a wicked charm in it,</p>
<p>A spell that sings seductive on to death.</p>
<p>Then paused she at one chamber; for a breath</p>
<p>Listened: and here her son Sir Ewain slept,</p>
<p>He who of ravens a black army kept,</p>
<p>In war than fiercest men more terrible,</p>
<p>That tore forth eyes of kings who blinded fell.</p>
<p>Sure that he slept, to Urience stole and stood</p>
<p>Dim by his couch. About her heart hot blood</p>
<p>Caught strangling, then throbbed thudding fever up</p>
<p>To her broad eyes, like wine whirled in a cup.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then came rare Recollection, with a mouth</p>
<p>Sweet as the honeyed sunbeams of the South</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
<p>Trickling thro' perplexed ripples of low leaves;</p>
<p>To whose faint form a veil of starshine cleaves</p>
<p>Intricate gauze from memoried eyes to feet;&mdash;</p>
<p>Feet sandaled with crushed, sifted snows and fleet</p>
<p>To come and go and airy anxiously.</p>
<p>She, trembling to her, like a flower a bee</p>
<p>Nests in and makes an audible mouth of musk</p>
<p>Dripping a downy language in the dusk,</p>
<p>Laid lips to ears and luted memories of</p>
<p>Now hateful Urience:&mdash;Her maiden love,</p>
<p>That willing went from Caerlleon to Gore</p>
<p>One dazzling day of Autumn. How a boar,</p>
<p>Wild as the wonder of the blazing wood,</p>
<p>Raged at her from a cavernous solitude,</p>
<p>Which, crimson-creepered, yawned the bristling curse</p>
<p>Murderous upon her; how her steed waxed worse</p>
<p>And, snorting terror, fled unmanageable,</p>
<p>Pursued with fear, and flung her from the selle,</p>
<p>Soft slipping on a bank of springy moss</p>
<p>That couched her swooning. In an utter loss</p>
<p>Of mind and limbs she only knew twas thus&mdash;</p>
<p>As one who pants beneath an incubus:&mdash;</p>
<p>The boar thrust toward her a tusked snout and fanged</p>
<p>Of hideous bristles, and the whole wood clanged</p>
<p>And buzzed and boomed a thousand sounds and lights</p>
<p>Lawless about her brain, like leaves fierce nights</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
<p>Of hurricane harvest shouting: then she knew</p>
<p>A fury thunder twixt it&mdash;and fleet flew</p>
<p>Rich-rooted moss and sandy loam that held</p>
<p>Dark-buried shadows of the wild, and swelled</p>
<p>Continual echoes with the thud of strife,</p>
<p>And breath of man and brute that warred for life;</p>
<p>And all the air, made mad with foam and forms,</p>
<p>Spun froth and wrestled twixt her hair and arms,</p>
<p>While trampled caked the stricken leaves or shred</p>
<p>Hummed whirling, and snapped brittle branches dead.</p>
<p>And when she rose and leaned her throbbing head,</p>
<p>Which burst its uncoifed rays of raven hair</p>
<p>Down swelling shoulders pure and faultless fair,</p>
<p>On one milk, marvelous arm of fluid grace,</p>
<p>Beheld the brute thing throttled and the face</p>
<p>Of angry Urience over, browed like Might,</p>
<p>One red, swoln arm, that pinned the hairy fright,</p>
<p>Strong as a god's, iron at the gullet's brawn;</p>
<p>Dug in his midriff, the close knees updrawn</p>
<p>Wedged deep the glutton sides that quaked and strove</p>
<p>A shaggy bulk, whose sharp hoofs horny drove.</p>
<p>Thus man and brute burned bent; when Urience slipped</p>
<p>One arm, the horror's tearing tusks had ripped</p>
<p>And ribboned redly, to the dagger's hilt,</p>
<p>Which at his hip hung long a haft gold-gilt;</p>
<p>Its rapid splinter drew; beamed twice and thrice</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
<p>High in the sun its ghastliness of ice</p>
<p>Plunged&mdash;and the great boar, stretched in sullen death,</p>
<p>Weakened thro' wild veins, groaned laborious breath.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And how he brought her water from a well</p>
<p>That rustled freshness near them, as it fell</p>
<p>From its full-mantled urn, in his deep casque,</p>
<p>And prayed her quaff; then bathed her brow, a task</p>
<p>That had accompaning tears of joy and vows</p>
<p>Of love, sweet intercourse of eyes and brows,</p>
<p>And many clinging kisses eloquent.</p>
<p>And how, when dressed his arm, behind him bent</p>
<p>She clasped him on the same steed and they went</p>
<p>On thro' the gold wood toward the golden West,</p>
<p>Till on one low hill's forest-covered crest</p>
<p>Up in the gold his castle's battlements pressed.</p>
<p>And then she felt she'd loved him till had come</p>
<p>Fame of the love of Isoud, whom from home</p>
<p>Brought knightly Tristram o'er the Irish foam,</p>
<p>And Guenevere's for Launcelot of the Lake.</p>
<p>And then how passion from these seemed to wake</p>
<p>Longing for some great gallant who would slake&mdash;</p>
<p>And such found Accolon.</p>
<p class="i12">              And then she thought</p>
<p>How far she'd fallen and how darkly fraught</p>
<p>With consequence was this. Then what distress</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>
<p>Were hers and his&mdash;her lover's; and success</p>
<p>How doubly difficult if Arthur slain,</p>
<p>King Urience lived to assert his right to reign.</p>
<p>So paused she pondering on the blade; her lips</p>
<p>Breathless and close as close cold finger tips</p>
<p>Hugged the huge weapon's hilt. And so she sighed,</p>
<p>"Nay! long, too long hast lived who shouldst have died</p>
<p>Even in the womb abortive! who these years</p>
<p>Hast leashed sweet life to care with stinging tears,</p>
<p>A knot thus harshly severed!&mdash;As thou art</p>
<p>Into the elements naked!"</p>
<p class="i12">                O'er his heart</p>
<p>The long sword hesitated, lean as crime,</p>
<p>Descended redly once. And like a rhyme</p>
<p>Of nice words fairly fitted forming on,&mdash;</p>
<p>A sudden ceasing and the harmony gone,</p>
<p>So ran to death the life of Urience,</p>
<p>A strong song incomplete of broken sense.</p>
<p>There glowered the crimeful Queen. The glistening sword</p>
<p>Unfleshed, flung by her wronged and murdered lord;</p>
<p>And the dark blood spread broader thro' the sheet</p>
<p>To drip a horror at impassive feet</p>
<p>And blur the polished oak. But lofty she</p>
<p>Stood proud, relentless; in her ecstacy</p>
<p>A lovely devil; a crowned lust that cried</p>
<p>On Accolon; that harlot which defied</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
<p>Heaven with a voice of pulses clamorous as</p>
<p>Steep storm that down a cavernous mountain pass</p>
<p>Blasphemes an hundred echoes; with like power</p>
<p>The inner harlot called its paramour:</p>
<p>Him whom King Arthur had commanded, when</p>
<p>Borne from the lists, be granted her again</p>
<p>As his blithe gift and welcome from that joust,</p>
<p>For treacherous love and her adulterous lust.</p>
<p>And while she stood revolving how her deed's</p>
<p>Concealment were secured,&mdash;a grind of steeds,</p>
<p>Arms, jingling stirrups, voices loud that cursed</p>
<p>Fierce in the northern court. To her athirst</p>
<p>For him her lover, war and power it spoke,</p>
<p>Him victor and so King; and then awoke</p>
<p>A yearning to behold, to quit the dead.</p>
<p>So a wild specter down wide stairs she fled,</p>
<p>Burst on a glare of links and glittering mail,</p>
<p>That shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail.</p>
<p>To her a bulk of iron, bearded fierce,</p>
<p>Down from a steaming steed into her ears,</p>
<p>"This from the King, a boon!" laughed harsh and hoarse;</p>
<p>Two henchmen beckoned, who pitched sheer with force,</p>
<p>Loud clanging at her feet, hacked, hewn and red,</p>
<p>Crusted with blood a knight in armor&mdash;dead;</p>
<p>Even Accolon, tossed with the mocking scoff</p>
<p>"This from the King!"&mdash;phantoms in fog rode off.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>
<p>And what remains? From Camelot to Gore</p>
<p>That right she weeping fled; then to the shore,&mdash;</p>
<p>As that romancer tells,&mdash;Avilion,</p>
<p>Where she hath Majesty gold-crowned yet wan;</p>
<p>In darkest cypress a frail pitious face</p>
<p>Queenly and lovely; 'round sad eyes the trace</p>
<p>Of immemorial tears as for some crime:</p>
<p>They future fixed, expectant of the time</p>
<p>When the forgiving Arthur cometh and</p>
<p>Shall have to rule all that lost golden land</p>
<p>That drifts vague amber in forgotten seas</p>
<p>Of surgeless turquoise dim with mysteries.</p>
<p>And so was seen Morgana nevermore,</p>
<p>Save once when from the Cornwall coast she bore</p>
<p>The wounded Arthur from that last fought fight</p>
<p>Of Camlan in a black barge into night.</p>
<p>But oft some see her with a palfried band</p>
<p>Of serge-stoled maidens thro' the drowsy land</p>
<p>Of Autumn glimmer; when are sharply strewn</p>
<p>The red leaves, while broad in the east a moon</p>
<p>Swings full of frost a lustrous globe of gleams,</p>
<p>Faint on the mooning hills as shapes in dreams.</p>

<p>I met him here at Ammendorf one Spring,</p>
<p>Toward the close of April when the Harz,</p>
<p>Veined to their ruin-crested summits, pulsed</p>
<p>A fluid life of green and budded gold</p>
<p>Beneath pure breathing skies of boundless blue:</p>
<p>Where low-yoked oxen, yellow to the knees,</p>
<p>Along the fluted meadow, freshly ploughed,</p>
<p>Plodded and snuffed the fragrance of the soil,</p>
<p>The free bird sang exultant in the sun.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
<p>Triumphant Spring with hinted hopes of May</p>
<p>And jaunty June, her mouth a puckered rose.</p>
<p>Here at this very hostelery o' The Owl;</p>
<p>Mine host there sleek served cannikins of wine</p>
<p>Beneath that elm now touseled by that shrew,</p>
<p>Lean Winter. Well!&mdash;a lordly vintage that!</p>
<p>With tang of fires which had sucked out their soul</p>
<p>From feverish sun-vats, cooled it from the moon's;</p>
<p>From wine-skin bellies of the bursting grape</p>
<p>Trodden, in darkness of old cellars aged</p>
<p>Even to the tingling smack of olden earth.</p>
<p>Rich! I remember!&mdash;wine that spurred the blood&mdash;</p>
<p>Thou hast none such, I swear, nor wilt again!&mdash;</p>
<p>That brought the heart loud to the generous mouth,</p>
<p>And made the eyes unlatticed casements whence</p>
<p>The good man's soul laughed interested out.</p>
<p>Stoups of rare royal Rhenish, such they say</p>
<p>As Necromance hides guarded in vast casks</p>
<p>Of antique make far in the Kyffh√§user,</p>
<p>The Cellar of the Knights near Sittendorf.</p>
<p class="i2">So, mellowed by that wine to friendship frank,</p>
<p>He spake me his intent in coming here;</p>
<p>But not one word of what his parentage;</p>
<p>But this his name was, Rudolf, and his home,</p>
<p>Franconia; but nor why he left nor when:</p>
<p>His mind to live a forester and be</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>
<p>Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick's train</p>
<p>Of buff and green; and so to his estate</p>
<p>Even now was bound, a youth of twenty-three.</p>
<p>And when he ceased the fire in his eyes</p>
<p>Worked restless as a troubled animal's,</p>
<p>Which hate-enraged can burn a steady flame,</p>
<p>Brute merciless. And thus I mused with me,</p>
<p>When he had ceased to fulminate at state,</p>
<p>"Another Count von Hackelnburg the fiend</p>
<p>Hath tricked unto the chase!&mdash;for hounds from Hell?"</p>
<p>But answered nothing, save light words of cheer</p>
<p>As best become fleet friends warm wine doth make.</p>
<p class="i2">Then as it chanced, old Kurt had come that morn</p>
<p>With some six of his jerkined foresters</p>
<p>From the Thuringian forest; damp with dew;</p>
<p>Red-cheeked as morn with early travel; bound</p>
<p>For Brunswick, Dummburg and the Hakel passed.</p>
<p>Chief huntsman he then to the goodly Duke,</p>
<p>And father of the sunniest maiden here</p>
<p>In Ammendorf, the blameless Ilsabe;</p>
<p>Who, motherless, the white-haired father prized</p>
<p>A jewel priceless. As huge barons' ghosts</p>
<p>Guard big, accumulated hoards of wealth,</p>
<p>Fast-sealed in caverned cellars, robber wells,</p>
<p>Beneath the dungeoned Dummburg, so he watched</p>
<p>Her, all his world in her who was his wealth.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
<p class="i2">A second Lora of Thuringia she.</p>
<p>Faultless for love, instilled all souls with love,</p>
<p>Who, in the favor of her maiden smile,</p>
<p>Felt friendship grow up like a golden thought;</p>
<p>A life of love from words; and light that fell</p>
<p>And wrought calm influence from her pure blue eyes.</p>
<p>Hair sedate and austerely dressed o'er brows</p>
<p>White as a Harz dove's wing; hair with the hue</p>
<p>Of twilight mists the sun hath soaked with gold.</p>
<p>A Tyrolean melody that brought</p>
<p>Dim dreams of Alpine heights, of shepherds brown,</p>
<p>Goat-skinned, with healthy cheeks and wrinkled lips</p>
<p>That fill wild oaten pipes on wand'ring ways,</p>
<p>Embowered deep, with mountain melodies,&mdash;</p>
<p>Simple with love and plaintive even to tears,&mdash;</p>
<p>Her presence, her sweet presence like a song.</p>
<p>And when she left, it was as when one hath</p>
<p>Beheld a moonlit Undine, ere the mind</p>
<p>Adjusts one thought, cleave thro' the glassy Rhine</p>
<p>A glittering beauty wet, and gone again</p>
<p>A flash&mdash;the soul drifts wondering on in dreams.</p>
<p class="i2">Some thirty years agone is that; and I,</p>
<p>Commissioner of the Duke&mdash;no sinecure</p>
<p>I can assure you&mdash;had scarce reached the age</p>
<p>Of thirty (then some three years of that House).</p>
<p>Thro' me the bold Franconian, whom at first,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>
<p>By bitter principles and scorn of state&mdash;</p>
<p>Developed into argument thro' wine&mdash;</p>
<p>The foresthood like was to be denied,</p>
<p>Was then enfellowed. "Yes," I said, "he's young;</p>
<p>True, rashly young! yet, see: a wiry frame,</p>
<p>A chamois' footing, and a face for right;</p>
<p>An eye which likes me not, but quick with pride,</p>
<p>And aimed at thought, a butt it may not miss:</p>
<p>A soul with virgin virtues which crude flesh</p>
<p>Makes seem but vices, these but God may see&mdash;</p>
<p>Develop these. But, if there's aught of worth,</p>
<p>Body or mind, in him, Kurt, thou wilt know,</p>
<p>And to the surface wear, as divers win</p>
<p>From hideous ooze and life rich jewels lost</p>
<p>Of polished pureness, worthless left to night,</p>
<p>Thou or thy daughter, and inspire for good."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">A year thereafter was it that I heard</p>
<p>Of Rudolf's passion for Kurt's Ilsabe,</p>
<p>Then their betrothal. And it was from this,&mdash;</p>
<p>For, ah, that Ilsabe! that Ilsabe!&mdash;</p>
<p>Good Mary Mother! how she haunts me yet!</p>
<p>She, that true touchstone which philosophers feign</p>
<p>Contacts and golds all base; a woman who</p>
<p>Could touch all evil into good in man.&mdash;</p>
<p>Surmised I of the excellency which</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
<p>Refinement of her gentle company,</p>
<p>Warm presence of chaste beauty, had resolved</p>
<p>His fiery nature to, conditioning slave.</p>
<p>And so I came from Brunswick&mdash;as you know&mdash;</p>
<p>Is custom of the Duke or, by his seal</p>
<p>Commissioned proxy, his commissioner,&mdash;</p>
<p>To test the marksmanship of Rudolf who</p>
<p>Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child,</p>
<p>An heir of Kuno.&mdash;He?&mdash;Great grandfather</p>
<p>Of Kurt, and one this forestkeepership</p>
<p>Was first possesor of; established thus&mdash;</p>
<p>Or such the tale they told me 'round the hearths.</p>
<p class="i2">Kuno, once in the Knight of Wippach's train,</p>
<p>Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke, who came</p>
<p>With vast magnificence of knights and hounds,</p>
<p>And satin-tuniced nobles curled and plumed</p>
<p>To hunt Thuringian deer. Then Morn too slow</p>
<p>On her blithe feet was; quick with laughing eyes</p>
<p>To morrow mortal eyes and lazy limbs;</p>
<p>Rather on tip-toed hills recumbent yawned,</p>
<p>Aroused an hour too soon; ashamed, disrobed,</p>
<p>Rubbed the stiff sleep from eyes that still would close,</p>
<p>While brayed the hollow horns and bayed lean hounds,</p>
<p>And cheered gallants until the dingles dinned,</p>
<p>Where searched the climbing mists or, compact light,</p>
<p>Fled breathless white, clung scared a moted gray,</p>
<p>Low unsunned cloudlands of the castled hills.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
<p class="i2">And then near mid-noon from a swarthy brake</p>
<p>The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag,</p>
<p>Lashed to whose back with grinding knotted cords,</p>
<p>Borne with whom like a nightmare's incubus,</p>
<p>A man shrieked; burry-bearded and his hair</p>
<p>Kinked with dry, tangled burrs, and he himself</p>
<p>Emaciated and half naked. From</p>
<p>The wear of wildest passage thro' the wild,</p>
<p>Rent red by briars, torn and bruised by rocks.</p>
<p>&mdash;For, such the law then, when the peasant chased</p>
<p>Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords,</p>
<p>As punishment the torturing withes and spine</p>
<p>Of some big stag, a gift of game and wild</p>
<p>Enough till death&mdash;death in the antlered herd</p>
<p>Or crawling famine in bleak, haggard haunts.</p>
<p>Then was the dark Duke glad, and forthwith cried</p>
<p>To all his dewy train a rich reward</p>
<p>For him who slew the stag and saved the man,</p>
<p>But death to him who slew the man and stag,</p>
<p>The careless error of a loose attempt.</p>
<p>So crashed the hunt along wild, glimmering ways</p>
<p>Thro' creepers and vast brush beneath gnarled trees,</p>
<p>Up a scorched torrent's bed. Yet still refused</p>
<p>Each that sure shot; the risk too desperate</p>
<p>The poor life and the golden gift beside.</p>
<p>So this young Kuno with two eyes wherein</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
<p>Hunt with excitement kindled reckless fire</p>
<p>Clamored, "And are ye cowards?&mdash;Good your grace,</p>
<p>You shall not chafe!&mdash;The fiend direct my ball!"</p>
<p>And fired into a covert deeply packed,</p>
<p>An intertangled wall of matted night,</p>
<p>Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive</p>
<p>To pierce one foot or earn one point beyond.</p>
<p>But, ha! the huge stag staggered from the brake</p>
<p>Heart-hit and perished. That wan wretch unhurt</p>
<p>Soon bondless lay condoled. But the great Duke,</p>
<p>Charmed with the eagle shot, admired the youth,</p>
<p>There to him and his heirs forever gave</p>
<p>The forest keepership.</p>
<p class="i12">          But envious tongues</p>
<p>Were soon at wag; and whispered went the tale</p>
<p>Of how the shot was free, and that the balls</p>
<p>Used by young Kuno were free bullets, which</p>
<p>Molded were cast in influence of the fiend</p>
<p>By magic and directed by the fiend.</p>
<p>Of some effect these tales were and some force</p>
<p>Had with the Duke, who lent an ear so far</p>
<p>As to ordain Kuno's descendants all</p>
<p>To proof of skill ere their succession to</p>
<p>The father's office. Kurt himself hath shot</p>
<p>The silver ring from out the popinjay's beak&mdash;</p>
<p>A good shot he, you see, who would succeed.</p>

<p class="i2">The Devil guards his mysteries close as God.</p>
<p>For who can say what elementaries</p>

<p>Shadowy? malicious vassals of that power</p>
<p>Who signs himself, thro' these, a slave to those,</p>
<p>Those mortals who act open with his Hell,</p>
<p>Those only who seek secretly and woo.</p>
<p class="i2">Of these free, fatal bullets let me speak:</p>
<p>There may be such; our Earth hath things as strange;</p>

<p>From Ignorance's mossy thatches low.</p>

<p>A solitude convulsed of rocks and trees</p>
<p>Blasted; and on the stony cross-road drawn</p>

<p>Herein rude characters; a skull and thighs</p>
<p>Fantastic fixed before a fitful fire</p>
<p>Of spiteful coals. Eleven of the clock</p>
<p>Cast, the first bullet leaves the mold,&mdash;the lead</p>
<p>Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark,</p>

<p>Unswallowed and unhallowed, oozed when shot</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
<p>Fixed to a riven pine.&mdash;Ere twelve o'clock,</p>
<p>When dwindling specters in their rotting shrouds</p>
<p>Quit musty tombs to mumble hollow woes</p>
<p>In Midnight's horrored ear, with never a cry,</p>
<p>Word or weak whisper, till that hour sound,</p>
<p>Must the free balls be cast; and these shall be</p>
<p>In number three and sixty; three of which</p>
<p>Semial&mdash;he the Devil's minister&mdash;</p>
<p>Claims for his master and stamps as his own</p>

<p><i>Those other sixty shall not miss their mark.</i></p>
<p class="i2">No cry, no word, no whisper, tho' there gibe</p>
<p>Most monstrous shapes that flicker in thick mist</p>
<p>Lewd human countenances or leer out</p>
<p>Swoln animal faces with fair forms of men,</p>
<p>While wide-winged owls fan the drear, dying coals,</p>
<p>That lick thin, slender tongues of purple fire</p>
<p>From viperous red, and croaks the night-hawk near.</p>
<p>No cry, no word, no whisper should there come</p>
<p>Weeping a wandering form with weary, white</p>
<p>And pleading countenance of her you love,</p>
<p>Faded with tears of waiting; beckoning</p>
<p>With gray, large arms or censuring; her shame</p>
<p>In dull and desolate eyes; who, if you speak</p>
<p>Or stagger from that circle&mdash;hideous change!&mdash;</p>
<p>Shrinks, faced a hag of million wrinkles, which</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>
<p>Ridge scaly sharpness of protruding bones,</p>
<p>To rip you limb from limb with taloned claws.</p>
<p>Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell</p>
<p>Boom that anticipated hour, nor leave</p>
<p>By one short inch the bloody orbit, for</p>
<p>The minion varlets of Hell's majesty</p>
<p>Expectant cirque its dim circumference.</p>
<p>But when the hour of midnight smites, be sure</p>
<p>You have your bullets, neither more nor less;</p>
<p>For, if thro' fear one more or less you have,</p>
<p>Your soul is forfeit to those agencies,</p>
<p>Right rathe who are to rend it from the flesh.</p>
<p>And while that hour of midnight sounds a din</p>
<p>Of hurrying hoofs and shouting outriders&mdash;</p>
<p>Six snorting steeds postilioned roll a stage</p>
<p>Black and with groaning wheels of spinning fire,</p>
<p>"Room there!&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;who bars the mountain-way!</p>
<p>On over him!"&mdash;but fear not nor fare forth,&mdash;</p>
<p>'Tis but the last trick of your bounden slave:</p>

<p>And, spun a spiral spark into the night,</p>
<p>Whistling the phantom flies and fades away.</p>
<p>Some say there comes no stage, but Hackelnburg,</p>
<p>Wild Huntsman of the Harz, rides hoarse in storm,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
<p>Dashing the dead leaves with dark dogs of hell</p>
<p>Direful thro' whirling thickets, and his horn</p>
<p>Croaks doleful as an owl's hoot while he hurls</p>
<p>Straight 'neath rain-streaming skies of echoes, sheer</p>
<p>Plunging the magic circle horse and hounds.</p>
<p>And then will come, plutonian clad and slim,</p>
<p>Upon a stallion vast intensely black,</p>
<p>Semial, Satan's lurid minister,</p>
<p>To hail you and inform you and assure.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Enough! these wives-tales heard to what I've seen;</p>
<p>To Ammendorf I came; and Rudolf there</p>
<p>With Kurt and all his picturesque foresters</p>
<p>Met me. And then the rounding year was ripe;</p>
<p>Throbbing the red heart of full Autumn: When</p>
<p>Each morning gleams crisp frost on shriveled fields;</p>
<p>Each noon sits veiled in mysteries of mist;</p>
<p>Each night unrolls a miracle woof of stars,</p>
<p>Where moon&mdash;bare-bosomed goddess of the hunt&mdash;</p>
<p>Wades calm, crushed clouds or treads the vaster blue.</p>
<p>Then I proposed the season's hunt; till eve</p>
<p>The test of Rudolf's skill postponed, with which</p>
<p>Annoyed he seemed. And so it was I heard</p>
<p>How he an execrable marksman was,</p>
<p>And whispered tales of near, incredible shots</p>
<p>That wryed their mark, while in his flint-lock's pan</p>
<p>Flashed often harmless powder, while wild game</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>
<p>Stared fearless on him and indulgent stood,</p>
<p>An open butt to such wide marksmanship.</p>
<p class="i2">Howbeit, he that day acquitted him</p>
<p>Of these maligners' cavils; in the hunt</p>
<p>Missing no shot however rash he made</p>
<p>Or distant thro' thick intercepting trees;</p>
<p>And the piled, curious game brought down of all</p>
<p>Good marksmen of that train had not sufficed,</p>
<p>Doubled, nay, trebled, to have matched his heap.</p>
<p>And wonderstruck the <i>j√§gers</i> saw, nor knew</p>
<p>How to excuse them. My indulgence giv'n,</p>
<p>Still swore that only yesterday old Kurt</p>
<p>Had touched his daughter's tears and Rudolf's wrath</p>
<p>By vowing end to their betroth√©d love,</p>
<p>Unless that love developed better aim</p>
<p>Against the morrow's test; his ancestor's</p>
<p>High fame should not be damaged. So he stormed,</p>
<p>But bowed his gray head and wept silently;</p>
<p>Then looking up forgave when big he saw</p>
<p>Tears in his daughter's eyes and Rudolf gone</p>
<p>Forth in the night that wailed with coming storm.</p>
<p class="i2">Before this inn, The Owl, assembled came</p>
<p>The nice-primped villagers to view the trial:</p>
<p>Fair <i>fr√§uleins</i> and blonde, comely, healthy <i>fraus</i>;</p>
<p>Stout burgers. And among them I did mark</p>
<p>Kurt and his daughter. He, a florid face</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
<p>Of pride and joy for Rudolf's strange success;</p>
<p>She, radiant and flounced in flowing garb</p>
<p>Of bridal white deep-draped and crowned with flowers;</p>
<p>For Kurt insisted this their marriage eve</p>
<p>Should Rudolf come successful from the chase.</p>
<p class="i2">So pleased was I with what I'd seen him do,</p>
<p>The test of skill superfluous seemed and so</p>
<p>Was on the bare brink of announcement, when,</p>
<p>Out of the evening heaven's hardening red,</p>
<p>Like a white warning loosed for augury,</p>
<p>A word of God some fallen angel prized</p>
<p>As his last all of heaven, penitent,</p>
<p>Hell-freed, sent minister to save a soul,</p>
<p>A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there,</p>
<p>A wafted waif, pruned settled on a bough:</p>
<p>Then I, "Thy weapon, Rudolph, pierce its head!"</p>
<p>Cried pointing, "And chief-forester art thou!"</p>
<p>Pale as a mist and wavering he turned;</p>
<p>"I had a dream&mdash;" then faltered as he aimed,</p>
<p>"A woman's whim!" But starting from the press</p>
<p>Screamed Ilsabe, "My dove!" to plead its life</p>
<p>Came&mdash;cracked the rifle and untouched the dove</p>
<p>Rose beating lustrous wings, but Ilsabe&mdash;</p>
<p>"God's wrath! the sight!"&mdash;fell smitten, and the blood</p>
<p>Sprang red from shattered brow and silent hair&mdash;</p>
<p>That bullet strangely thro' her brow and brain....</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
<p>And what of Rudolf? ah! of him you ask?</p>
<p>That proud Franconian who would scoff at Fate</p>
<p>And scorn all state; who cried black Satan friend</p>
<p>Sooner than our white Christ;&mdash;why, he went mad</p>
<p>O' the moment, and into the haunted Harz</p>
<p>Fled, an unholy thing, and perished there</p>
<p>The prey of demons of the Dummburg. But</p>
<p>I one of few less superstitious who</p>
<p>Say, as the finale of a madman's deed,</p>
<p>He in the Bod√©, from that ragged rock,</p>
<p>The Devil's Dancing Place, did leap and die.</p>

OF CLARE.</h3>

<h4><i>Year 13&mdash;.</i></h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="dropcap1" style="width: 0.6em;">B</span><b>ARBICAN</b>, bartizan, battlement,</p>
<p>With the Abergavenny mountains blent,</p>
<p>Look, from the Raglan tower of Gwent,</p>
<p>My lord Hugh Clifford's ancient home</p>
<p>Shows, clear morns of the Spring or Summer,</p>
<p>Thrust out like thin flakes o' a silver foam</p>
<p>From a climbing cloud, for the hills gloom glummer,</p>
<p>Being shaggy with heath, yon.&mdash;I was his page;</p>
<p>A favorite then; and he of that age</p>
<p>When a man will love and be loved again,</p>
<p>Or die in the wars or a monastery:</p>
<p>Or toil till he stifle his heart's hard pain,</p>
<p>Or drink, drug his hopes and his lost love bury.</p>
<p>I was his page; and often we fared</p>
<p>Thro' the Clare desmene in Autumn hawking&mdash;</p>
<p>If the baron had known how he would have glared</p>
<p>From their bushy brows eyes dark with mocking!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
<p>&mdash;That of the Strongbows, Richard, I mean&mdash;</p>
<p>Had growled to his yeomen, "A score! mount, Keene!</p>
<p>Forth and spit me this Clifford, or hang</p>
<p>With his crop-eared page to the closest oak!"</p>
<p>For he and the Cliffords had ever a fang</p>
<p>In the other's side,... but I see him choke</p>
<p>And strangle with wrath when his hawker told&mdash;</p>
<p>If he told!&mdash;how we met on that flowery wold</p>
<p>His daughter, sweet Hortense of Clare, the day</p>
<p>Her hooded tiercel its brails did burst</p>
<p>To trail with its galling jesses away;</p>
<p>An untrained haggard the falconer cursed,</p>
<p>Vain whistled to lure; when the eyas sped</p>
<p>Slant, low and heavily overhead</p>
<p>By us; and Sir Hugh,&mdash;who had just then cast</p>
<p>His peregrine fierce at a heron-quarry,&mdash;</p>
<p>In his stirrups rising, thus&mdash;as it passed,</p>
<p>By the jesses caught and to her did carry,</p>
<p>Lingering slender and tall by a rose</p>
<p>Whence she pulled the berries&mdash;But no two foes</p>
<p>Her eyes and Sir Hugh's!&mdash;And I swear each felt</p>
<p>A song in their hearts!&mdash;For I heard him quaver</p>
<p>Somewhat and then&mdash;by Mary!&mdash;he knelt!&mdash;</p>
<p>And the Lady herself in her words did waver</p>
<p>And wonder with smiles. Then daintily took</p>
<p>The hawk on her fist where it pruned and shook</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
<p>Its callowness ragged, as Hugh did seize</p>
<p>Softly the other hand long and white,&mdash;</p>
<p>Reached forth to him craving him rise from his knees,&mdash;</p>
<p>And mouthed with moist kisses an hundred quite.</p>
<p>Tho' she blushed up burning, no frowned "Beware!"</p>
<p>But seemed so happy! when crushing thro'&mdash;</p>
<p>Her sturdy retainer with swarthy stare&mdash;</p>
<p>The underwoods burst; and her maiden crew</p>
<p>Drew near them naming her name, and came</p>
<p>With leaves and dim Autumn blossoms aflame.&mdash;</p>
<p>"Their words?" I know not! for how should I?&mdash;</p>
<p>I paged my master but was no spy.</p>
<p>Nothings, I think, as all lovers', you know;</p>
<p>Yet how should I hear such whispered low,</p>
<p>Quick by the wasted woodland yellow?</p>
<p>When up thro' the brush thrashed that burly fellow</p>
<p>With his ale-coarse face, and so made a pause</p>
<p>In the pulse of their words, there my lord Sir Hugh</p>
<p>Stood with the soil on his knee: No cause</p>
<p>Had he&mdash;but his hanger he halfway drew&mdash;</p>
<p>Then paused, thrust it <i>clap</i> in its sheath again</p>
<p>And bowed to the Lady and strode away;</p>
<p>Up, vault, on his steed&mdash;and we rode amain</p>
<p>Gay to his towers that merry day.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He loved and was loved,&mdash;why, I knew!&mdash;for look,</p>

<p>To ride in the Raglan marches and hawk</p>
<p>And to hunt and to wander. And found a lair,</p>
<p>In the Strongbow forest, of bush and of rock,</p>
<p>Of moss and thick ferns; where Hortense of Clare,</p>
<p>How often I wis not, met him by chance&mdash;</p>
<p>Perhaps!&mdash;Sweet sorceress out of romance,</p>
<p>Those tomes of Geoffrey&mdash;for she was fair!</p>
<p>Her large, warm eyes and hair,... ah, hair,</p>
<p>How may one picture or liken it!</p>
<p>With the golden gloss of its full brown, fit</p>
<p>For the Viviane face of lovable white</p>
<p>Beneath;&mdash;like a star that a cloud of night</p>
<p>Stops over to threaten but never will drench</p>
<p>Its tremulous beauty with mists that quench.&mdash;</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Heigho!&mdash;but they ceased, those meetings. I wot</p>
<p>Watched of the baron, his menial crew;</p>
<p>For she loved too well to have once forgot</p>
<p>The place and the time of their trysting true.</p>
<p>But she came not&mdash;ah! and again came not:</p>
<p>"<i>Why and when?</i>" would question Sir Hugh</p>
<p>In his labored scrawls a crevice of rock&mdash;</p>
<p>The lovers' post&mdash;in its coigne would lock.</p>
<p>Until near Yule Love gat them again</p>
<p>A twilight tryst&mdash;by frowardness sure.&mdash;</p>
<p>They met. And that day was gray with rain&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
<p>Or snow, and the wind did ever endure</p>
<p>A long, bleak moaning thorough the wood,</p>
<p>Smarted the cheek and chapped i' the blood;</p>
<p>And a burne in the forest cried "sob and sob,"</p>
<p>And whimpered forever a chopping throb</p>
<p>Thro' the rope-taunt boughs like a thing pursued.</p>
<p>&mdash;And there it was that he learned how she</p>
<p>(My faith! how it makes me burn and quiver</p>
<p>To think what a miserable despot he&mdash;</p>
<p>Lord Richard Strongbow, aye and ever</p>
<p>To his daughter was!) forsooth! must wed</p>
<p>With an Eastern Earl&mdash;some Lovell: one whom</p>
<p>(That God in His mercy had smote him dead!)</p>
<p>Hortense of Clare&mdash;but in baby bloom&mdash;</p>
<p>Never had mirrored with maiden eyes.</p>
<p>Sealed over a baby to strengthen some ties&mdash;</p>
<p>Of power or wealth&mdash;had been bartered then</p>
<p>And sold and purchased, and now ... but when</p>
<p>To her lover, the Clifford, she told this&mdash;there</p>
<p>He had faced with his love the talons of Death&mdash;</p>
<p>Only for her, who did stay with a stare</p>
<p>Of reproach all his heat and say in a breath,</p>
<p>"Is love, that thou sware to me aye and so often,</p>
<p>To live too feeble or&mdash;how?&mdash;doth it soften</p>
<p>And weaken away and&mdash;to die?&mdash;why die?&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
<p>Her words are glued here so!... I remember</p>
<p>All as well as that sullen December,</p>
<p>That blustered and bullied about them and</p>
<p>Spat stiff its spiteful and cold-cutting snow</p>
<p>Where they talked there dreamily hand in hand,</p>
<p>While the rubbing boughs clashed rattling low.</p>
<p>Her last words these, "By curfew sure</p>
<p>On Christmas eve at the postern door."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And we were there, and a void horse too:</p>
<p>Armed: for a journey I hardly knew</p>

<p>Our comrade's sure&mdash;of what loveliness!</p>
<p>Waited with love, impatience aflame.</p>
<p>While Raglan bulged its baronial girth</p>
<p>To roar to its battlements Yule and song;</p>
<p>Retainers loud rollicked in wassail and mirth</p>
<p>Where the mistletoe 'round the vast hearths hung,</p>
<p>And holly beberried the elden wall</p>
<p>Of curious oak in the banqueting hall.</p>
<p>And the spits, I trow, by the scullions turned</p>
<p>O'er the snoring logs, rich steamed and burned</p>
<p>With flesh; where the whole wild-boar was roasted</p>
<p>And the dun-deer flanks and the roebuck haunches;</p>
<p>Fat tuns of ale, that the cellars boasted,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
<p>Old casks of wine were broached for paunches</p>
<p>Of the vassals that reveled in bower and stall;</p>
<p>Pale pages who diced and bluff henchmen who quarr'led</p>

<p>Were wed to this Lovell this Christmas Eve.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Was she long&mdash;Did she come?"... By that postern we</p>
<p>Like shadows lurked. Said my lord Sir Hugh:</p>
<p>"Yon tower, remember!&mdash;that casement, see!&mdash;</p>
<p>When a stealthy light in its slit burns blue</p>
<p>And signals thrice slowly, thus&mdash;'tis she."</p>
<p>And about his person his gaberdine drew,</p>
<p>For the wind it hugged and the snow beat thro'.</p>
<p>Did she come?&mdash;We had watched for an hour or twain</p>
<p>Ere that light burned there in the central pane</p>
<p>And was flourished thrice and departed so.</p>
<p>Then closer we packed to the postern portal</p>
<p>Horses and all in the stinging snow.</p>
<p>Stiff with the cold was I.&mdash;Immortal</p>
<p>Minutes we waited breath-bated and listened</p>
<p>Shuddering there in the gusty gale.</p>
<p>Whizzing o'er parapets sifted and glistened</p>
<p>Wild drift, thro' battlements hissed in a veil.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
<p>Quoth my lord Sir Hugh, for his love was a-heat,</p>
<p>"She feels for the spring in the hidden panel</p>
<p>'Neath the tapestry ... ah! thou hast pressed it, sweet!</p>
<p>&mdash;How black gulps open the secret channel!</p>

<p>The massy bolts which the rust makes cling."</p>
<p>But ever some whim of the wind that shook</p>
<p>The clanging ring of a creaking hook</p>
<p>In the buttress or wall; and we waited so</p>
<p>Till the East grew gray. Did she come?&mdash;ah, no!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I must tell you why, and enough: 'Tis said</p>
<p>On the eve of the marriage she fled the side</p>
<p>Of the baron, the bridegroom too she fled,</p>
<p>With a mischievous laugh, "<i>I'll hide! I'll hide!</i></p>
<p>Seek! and be sure to seek well!" and led</p>
<p>A wild chase after her, but defied</p>
<p>All search for&mdash;a score and ten more years,</p>
<p>And the laughter of Yule was changed to tears.</p>
<p>But they searched and the snow was bleared with the glare</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
<p>Of torches that hurried thro' chamber and stair;</p>
<p>And tower and court re-echoed her name,</p>

<p>On hope, and his life was a weary sadness,</p>
<p>So he flung it away with a very gladness.</p>
<p>And the baron died&mdash;and the bridegroom, well,&mdash;</p>
<p>Unlucky that bridegroom, sooth!&mdash;to tell</p>
<p>Of him there is nothing. The baron died;</p>

<p>Soft that heaven; stainless as</p>
<p class="i2">The grand woodlands lunging on,</p>
<p class="i2">Wound majestic in the sun,</p>
<p>Or as our devotion was!</p>

<p class="i2">Freedom whom hoarse forests sang;</p>
<p class="i2">Heaven-browed her eyes, whence sprang</p>
<p>Audience august with law.</p>
<p>Wildernesses, from her hips</p>
<p class="i2">Sprung the giant forests there,</p>
<p class="i2">Tossed the cataracts from her hair,</p>
<p>Thunders lightened from her lips.</p>
<p>Oft some scavenger, with vane</p>
<p class="i2">Motionless, above we knew</p>
<p class="i2">Wheeled thro' altitudes of blue</p>
<p>By his rapid shadow's stain.</p>
<p>Or some cloud of sunny white,&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
<p>Shot with coruscating light.</p>
<p>So we dreamed an hour upon</p>
<p class="i2">Those warm rocks, dry, lichen-scabbed.</p>
<p class="i2">Lounged beneath long leaves that dabbed</p>
<p>At us coins of shade and sun.</p>
<p>Then arose and down some gorge</p>
<p class="i2">Made a bowldered torrent broad</p>
<p class="i2">The hurled pathway of our road</p>
<p>Tumbled down the mountain large.</p>
<p>At that farm-house, which you know,</p>
<p class="i2">Where old-fashioned flowers spun</p>
<p class="i2">Gay rag-carpets in the sun,</p>
<p>By green apple-boughs built low,</p>
<p>Rested from our hot descent;</p>
<p class="i2">One deep draught of cider cool,</p>
<p class="i2">Unctuous, our fierce veins to dull</p>
<p>At old Hix's eloquent....</p>
<p>On Wolf Mountain died the light;</p>
<p class="i2">A colossal blossom, rayed</p>
<p class="i2">With rent petaled clouds that played</p>
<p>'Round a calyxed fury bright.</p>
<p>Down the moist mint-scented vale</p>
<p class="i2">To the mining camp we turned,</p>
<p class="i2">Thro' the twilight faint discerned</p>
<p>With its crowded cabins pale.</p>
<p>Ah! those nights!&mdash;We wandered forth</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
<p class="i2">On some shadow-haunted path</p>
<p class="i2">When the moon was late and rathe</p>
<p>The large stars; sowed south and north,</p>
<p>Clustered bursting heavens down:</p>
<p class="i2">And the milky zodiac,</p>
<p class="i2">Rolled athwart the belted black,</p>
<p>Myriad-million-moted shone.</p>
<p>And in dreams we sauntered till</p>
<p class="i2">In the valley pale beneath,</p>
<p class="i2">From a dew-drop's vapored breath</p>
<p>To faint ghosts, there gathered still,</p>
<p>Grave creations weird of mist:</p>
<p class="i2">Then we knew the moonrise near,</p>
<p class="i2">As with necromance the air</p>
<p>Pulsed to pearl and amethyst.</p>
<p>Shrilled the insects of the dusk,</p>
<p class="i2">Grated, buzzed and strident sung</p>
<p class="i2">Till each leaf seemed tuned and strung</p>
<p>For high Pixy music brusque.</p>
<p>Stealing steps and stealthy sighs</p>
<p class="i2">As of near unhallowed things,</p>
<p class="i2">Rustled hair or fluttered wings,</p>
<p>Seemed about us; then the eyes</p>
<p>Of plumed phantom warriors</p>
<p class="i2">Burned mesmeric from some bush</p>
<p class="i2">Mournful in the goblin hush,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
<p>Then materialized to stars.</p>
<p>Mantled mists like ambushed braves,</p>
<p class="i2">Chiefed by some swart Blackfoot tall,</p>
<p class="i2">Stole along each forest wall&mdash;</p>
<p>Phosphorescent moony waves.</p>
<p>Then the moon rose; from some cup</p>
<p class="i2">Each hill's bowl,&mdash;magnetic shine,</p>
<p class="i2">Mist and silence poured like wine,&mdash;</p>
<p>Brimmed a monster goblet up.</p>
<p>Ingot from lost orient mines,</p>
<p class="i2">Delved by humpbacked gnomes of Night,</p>
<p class="i2">Full her orb loomed, nacreous white,</p>
<p>O'er Pine Mountain's druid pines.</p>
<p>As thro' fragmentary fleece</p>
<p class="i2">Her circumference polished broke,</p>
<p class="i2">Orey-seamed, about us woke</p>
<p>Myths of Italy and Greece.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;a chanson serenade&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">You, rich-voiced, to your guitar</p>
<p class="i2">To our goddess in that star</p>
<p>Sang "<i>Ne Tempo</i>" from the glade.</p>

<h3>Transcriber's Note</h3>

<p>There are some strange words, which have been retained, as the author
may have been using 'poetic licence':</p>

<p>e.g. 'aventured spears', which may have been quartz-tipped (aventurine);
'beryle', possibly referring to the color of beryl (light green, etc.);
'bowldered', alternative spelling for 'bouldered'; 'guant', which may be
'gaunt misspelled, or it may refer to a bird (guan)... "Laughed the
guant guards among the crowd"; etc. And 'accompaning' still needs to elide
the second 'a' to fit the metre.</p>

<p>Some words are obviously ancient, or dialectic, and some are akin to some of the
words in the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. The transcriber prefers
not to change anything the author wrote, as a slightly different
spelling may also imply a slightly different inflexion.</p>

<p>There are, however, two probable printer's errors, which have been
amended:</p>

<p>Page 129: 'passsion' corrected to 'passion': "To principles of passion and of
pride,"</p>

<p> Page 154: Removed extraneous 'the': "That hoot to the (the) riddling arrows of rain and of seas,"</p>

<p>(Corrections are also indicated, in the text, by a dotted line underneath the correction.</p>
<p style="margin-top:-1em;">Scroll the mouse over the word and the original text will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'apprear'">appear</ins>.)</p>
